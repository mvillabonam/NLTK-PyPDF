The nearest one could come to doing so\\nwould be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink. A full\\ntranslation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jeﬀerson’s words\\nwould be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.\\nA good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being trans-\\nformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve\\nthe memory of certain historical ﬁgures, while at the same time bringing their\\nachievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers, such as\\nShakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in\\nprocess of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writ-\\nings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed.\\nThese translations were a slow and diﬃcult business, and it was not expected\\nthat they would be ﬁnished before the ﬁrst or second decade of the twenty-\\nﬁrst century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature\\n— indispensable technical manuals, and the like — that had to be treated in\\nthe same way. It was chieﬂy in order to allow time for the preliminary work\\nof translation that the ﬁnal adoption of Newspeak had been ﬁxed for so late a\\ndate as 2050.\\n181\\n'"

      "was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire\n",
      "to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to ﬂow\n",
      "through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even\n",
      "against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that\n",
      "one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one\n",
      "object to another like the ﬂame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston’s\n",
      "hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against\n",
      "Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart\n",
      "went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and\n",
      "sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the\n",
      "people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true.\n",
      "At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration,\n",
      "and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing\n",
      "like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation,\n",
      "his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like\n",
      "some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the\n",
      "structure of civilization.\n",
      "It was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that\n",
      "by a voluntary act.\n",
      "Suddenly, by the sort of violent eﬀort with which one\n",
      "wrenches one’s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in\n",
      "transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind\n",
      "him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations ﬂashed through his mind. He would ﬂog\n",
      "her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and\n",
      "shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her\n",
      "throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why\n",
      "it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and\n",
      "sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because\n",
      "round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your\n",
      "arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.\n",
      "The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual\n",
      "sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then\n",
      "the sheep-face melted into the ﬁgure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be ad-\n",
      "vancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring\n",
      "out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row\n",
      "actually ﬂinched backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a\n",
      "deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile ﬁgure melted into the face of Big\n",
      "Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio’d, full of power and mysterious calm,\n",
      "and so vast that it almost ﬁlled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother\n",
      "was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that\n",
      "are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring\n",
      "conﬁdence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away\n",
      "again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:\n",
      "WAR IS PEACE\n",
      "FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\n",
      "8\n",
      "\n",
      "But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the\n",
      "screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone’s eyeballs was too\n",
      "vivid to wear oﬀimmediately. The little sandy-haired woman had ﬂung herself\n",
      "forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur\n",
      "that sounded like ’My Saviour!’\n",
      "she extended her arms towards the screen.\n",
      "Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a\n",
      "prayer.\n",
      "At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhyth-\n",
      "mical chant of ’B-B! ... B-B!’ — over and over again, very slowly, with a long\n",
      "pause between the ﬁrst ’B’ and the second-a heavy, murmurous sound, some-\n",
      "how curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp\n",
      "of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty\n",
      "seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of\n",
      "overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty\n",
      "of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drown-\n",
      "ing of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston’s entrails seemed to\n",
      "grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general\n",
      "delirium, but this sub-human chanting of ’B-B! ... B-B!’ always ﬁlled him with\n",
      "horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise.\n",
      "To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was\n",
      "doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds\n",
      "during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.\n",
      "And it was exactly at this moment that the signiﬁcant thing happened — if,\n",
      "indeed, it did happen.\n",
      "Momentarily he caught O’Brien’s eye. O’Brien had stood up. He had taken\n",
      "oﬀhis spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his\n",
      "characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes\n",
      "met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew — yes, he knew! —\n",
      "that O’Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message\n",
      "had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were\n",
      "ﬂowing from one into the other through their eyes. ’I am with you,’ O’Brien\n",
      "seemed to be saying to him. ’I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all\n",
      "about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don’t worry, I am on your\n",
      "side!’ And then the ﬂash of intelligence was gone, and O’Brien’s face was as\n",
      "inscrutable as everybody else’s.\n",
      "That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such\n",
      "incidents never had any sequel.\n",
      "All that they did was to keep alive in him\n",
      "the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party.\n",
      "Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all —\n",
      "perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless\n",
      "arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was\n",
      "not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no\n",
      "evidence, only ﬂeeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches\n",
      "of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls — once, even, when\n",
      "two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though\n",
      "it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had\n",
      "imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O’Brien\n",
      "again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his\n",
      "mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to\n",
      "set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal\n",
      "9\n",

      "glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event,\n",
      "in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.\n",
      "Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin\n",
      "was rising from his stomach.\n",

      "the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and\n",
      "abandon the enterprise altogether.\n",
      "He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether\n",

      "in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases\n",

      "Winston was dreaming of his mother.\n",
      "He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother\n",
      "had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow\n",
      "movements and magniﬁcent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely\n",
      "as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered\n",
      "especially the very thin soles of his father’s shoes) and wearing spectacles. The\n",
      "two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the ﬁrst great\n",
      "purges of the ﬁfties.\n",
      "At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath\n",
      "him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all,\n",
      "except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of\n",
      "them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place —\n",
      "the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave — but it was a place\n",
      "which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the\n",
      "saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There\n",
      "was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while\n",
      "they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment\n",
      "must hide them from sight for ever. He was out in the light and air while they\n",
      "were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was\n",
      "up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their\n",
      "faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the\n",
      "knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this\n",
      "was part of the unavoidable order of things.\n",
      "He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in\n",
      "some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacriﬁced to his own. It\n",
      "was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery,\n",
      "are a continuation of one’s intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of\n",
      "facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing\n",
      "that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother’s death, nearly thirty\n",
      "years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible.\n",
      "Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was\n",
      "still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by\n",
      "one another without needing to know the reason. His mother’s memory tore at\n",
      "his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selﬁsh\n",
      "to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had\n",
      "sacriﬁced herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable.\n",
      "Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred,\n",
      "16\n",
      "\n",
      "and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he\n",
      "seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him\n",
      "through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.\n",
      "Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when\n",
      "the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was looking\n",
      "at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not\n",
      "he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden\n",
      "Country.\n",
      "It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering\n",
      "across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite\n",
      "side of the ﬁeld the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the\n",
      "breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women’s hair. Somewhere\n",
      "near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where\n",
      "dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees.\n",
      "The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the ﬁeld. With what\n",
      "seemed a single movement she tore oﬀher clothes and ﬂung them disdainfully\n",
      "aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed\n",
      "he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration\n",
      "for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace\n",
      "and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of\n",
      "thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all\n",
      "be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too\n",
      "was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word\n",
      "’Shakespeare’ on his lips.\n",
      "The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on\n",
      "the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven ﬁfteen, getting-up time for\n",
      "oﬃce workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed — naked, for a member\n",
      "of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of\n",
      "pyjamas was 600 — and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were\n",
      "lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The\n",
      "next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing ﬁt which nearly always\n",
      "attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he\n",
      "could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of\n",
      "deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the eﬀort of the cough, and the varicose\n",
      "ulcer had started itching.\n",
      "’Thirty to forty group!’ yapped a piercing female voice. ’ Thirty to forty\n",
      "group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!’\n",
      "Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image\n",
      "of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes,\n",
      "had already appeared.\n",
      "’Arms bending and stretching!’ she rapped out. ’Take your time by me.\n",
      "One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of\n",
      "life into it! One, two, three four! One two, three, four! . . .’\n",
      "The pain of the coughing ﬁt had not quite driven out of Winston’s mind\n",
      "the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise\n",
      "restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing\n",
      "on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the\n",
      "Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period\n",
      "of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily diﬃcult. Beyond the late ﬁfties\n",
      "everything faded. When there were no external records that you could refer\n",
      "to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge\n",
      "17\n",
      "\n",
      "events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of\n",
      "incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long\n",
      "blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been diﬀerent\n",
      "then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been\n",
      "diﬀerent. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it\n",
      "had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had\n",
      "always been called London.\n",
      "Winston could not deﬁnitely remember a time when his country had not\n",
      "been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of\n",
      "peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid\n",
      "which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when\n",
      "the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself,\n",
      "but he did remember his father’s hand clutching his own as they hurried down,\n",
      "down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase\n",
      "which rang under his feet and which ﬁnally so wearied his legs that he began\n",
      "whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow, dreamy\n",
      "way, was following a long way behind them. She was carrying his baby sister —\n",
      "or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not\n",
      "certain whether his sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged into a\n",
      "noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station.\n",
      "There were people sitting all over the stone-ﬂagged ﬂoor, and other people,\n",
      "packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. Win-\n",
      "ston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the ﬂoor, and near\n",
      "them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. The\n",
      "old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from\n",
      "very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears.\n",
      "He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and\n",
      "one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But\n",
      "though slightly drunk he was also suﬀering under some grief that was genuine\n",
      "and unbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing,\n",
      "something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just\n",
      "happened. It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the\n",
      "old man loved — a little granddaughter, perhaps had been killed. Every few\n",
      "minutes the old man kept repeating:\n",
      "’We didn’t ought to ’ave trusted ’em. I said so, Ma, didn’t I? That’s what\n",
      "comes of trusting ’em. I said so all along. We didn’t ought to ’ave trusted the\n",
      "buggers.\n",
      "But which buggers they didn’t ought to have trusted Winston could not now\n",
      "remember.\n",
      "Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly\n",
      "speaking it had not always been the same war.\n",
      "For several months during\n",
      "his childhood there had been confused street ﬁghting in London itself, some of\n",
      "which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period,\n",
      "to say who was ﬁghting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly\n",
      "impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention\n",
      "of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example,\n",
      "in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with\n",
      "Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three\n",
      "powers had at any time been grouped along diﬀerent lines. Actually, as Winston\n",
      "well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia\n",
      "18\n",
      "\n",
      "and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge\n",
      "which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under\n",
      "control. Oﬃcially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at\n",
      "war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The\n",
      "enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any\n",
      "past or future agreement with him was impossible.\n",
      "The frightening thing, he reﬂected for the ten thousandth time as he forced\n",
      "his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their\n",
      "bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back\n",
      "muscles) — the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If the Party could\n",
      "thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened\n",
      "— that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?\n",
      "The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He,\n",
      "Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short\n",
      "a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own\n",
      "consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others\n",
      "accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records told the same tale —\n",
      "then the lie passed into history and became truth. ’Who controls the past,’ ran\n",
      "the Party slogan, ’controls the future: who controls the present controls the\n",
      "past.’ And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.\n",
      "Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite\n",
      "simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own\n",
      "memory. ’Reality control’, they called it: in Newspeak, ’doublethink’\n",
      "’Stand easy!’ barked the instructress, a little more genially.\n",
      "Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly reﬁlled his lungs with air. His\n",
      "mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not\n",
      "to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully con-\n",
      "structed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing\n",
      "them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against\n",
      "logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy\n",
      "was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget\n",
      "whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again\n",
      "at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and\n",
      "above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ulti-\n",
      "mate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to\n",
      "become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to\n",
      "understand the word ’doublethink’ involved the use of doublethink.\n",
      "The instructress had called them to attention again.\n",

      "For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any\n",

      "wrong. Winston’s job was to rectify the original ﬁgures by making them agree\n",
      "with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple er-\n",
      "ror which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as\n",
      "February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a ’categorical pledge’\n",
      "were the oﬃcial words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration\n",
      "during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be\n",
      "reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that\n",
      "was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would\n",
      "probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.\n",
      "As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his\n",
      "speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The Times and pushed\n",
      "them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as\n",
      "possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that\n",
      "he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured\n",
      "by the ﬂames.\n",
      "What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led,\n",
      "he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the\n",

      "no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any\n",
      "falsiﬁcation had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department,\n",
      "far larger than the one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons\n",

      "and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction.\n",
      "A number of The Times which might, because of changes in political alignment,\n",
      "or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen\n",
      "times still stood on the ﬁles bearing its original date, and no other copy existed\n",
      "to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and\n",

      "\n",
      "invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied\n",
      "that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips,\n",

      "interests of accuracy.\n",
      "But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty’s ﬁgures,\n",
      "it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense\n",
      "for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion\n",
      "with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained\n",
      "in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version\n",
      "as in their rectiﬁed version.\n",
      "A great deal of the time you were expected to\n",
      "make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty’s forecast\n",
      "had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The\n",
      "actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting\n",
      "the forecast, marked the ﬁgure down to ﬁfty-seven millions, so as to allow for\n",
      "the usual claim that the quota had been overfulﬁlled. In any case, sixty-two\n",
      "millions was no nearer the truth than ﬁfty-seven millions, or than 145 millions.\n",
      "Very likely no boots had been produced at all.\n",
      "Likelier still, nobody knew\n",
      "how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every\n",
      "quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps\n",
      "half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class\n",
      "of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in\n",
      "which, ﬁnally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.\n",
      "Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other\n",
      "side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working\n",
      "steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close\n",
      "to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what he\n",
      "was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up, and his\n",
      "spectacles darted a hostile ﬂash in Winston’s direction.\n",
      "Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed\n",
      "on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.\n",
      "In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless\n",
      "rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were\n",
      "quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he\n",
      "daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the\n",
      "Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman\n",
      "with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting\n",

      "There was a certain ﬁtness in this, since\n",

      "— of poems which had become ideologically oﬀensive, but which for one reason\n",
      "or another were to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its ﬁfty\n",
      "workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in\n",
      "the huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were\n",
      "other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There\n",
      "were the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts,\n",

      "\n",
      "actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies\n",
      "of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals\n",
      "which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where the corrected\n",
      "documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were\n",
      "destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing\n",

      "made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one\n",
      "falsiﬁed, and the other rubbed out of existence.\n",
      "And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of\n",

      "were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning\n",
      "wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could\n",
      "only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the ’free’\n",
      "market.\n",
      "’I’ve been using the same blade for six weeks,’ he added untruthfully.\n",
      "The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced\n",
      "Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of\n",
      "the counter.\n",
      "’Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?’ said Syme.\n",
      "’I was working,’ said Winston indiﬀerently. ’I shall see it on the ﬂicks, I\n",
      "suppose.’\n",
      "’A very inadequate substitute,’ said Syme.\n",
      "His mocking eyes roved over Winston’s face. ’I know you,’ the eyes seemed\n",
      "to say, ’I see through you. I know very well why you didn’t go to see those\n",
      "prisoners hanged.’ In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He\n",
      "27\n",
      "\n",
      "would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy\n",
      "villages, and trials and confessions of thought-criminals, the executions in the\n",
      "cellars of the Ministry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of getting\n",
      "him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities\n",
      "of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned\n",
      "his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.\n",
      "’It was a good hanging,’ said Syme reminiscently. ’I think it spoils it when\n",
      "they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above all, at the\n",
      "end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue a quite bright blue. That’s the\n",
      "detail that appeals to me.’\n",
      "’Nex’, please!’ yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.\n",
      "Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was\n",
      "dumped swiftly the regulation lunch — a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,\n",
      "a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coﬀee, and one\n",
      "saccharine tablet.\n",
      "’There’s a table over there, under that telescreen,’ said Syme. ’Let’s pick up\n",
      "a gin on the way.’\n",
      "The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded\n",
      "their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal-\n",
      "topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a ﬁlthy\n",
      "liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of\n",
      "gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuﬀ\n",
      "down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that\n",
      "he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among\n",
      "its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuﬀwhich was probably a\n",
      "preparation of meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their\n",
      "pannikins. From the table at Winston’s left, a little behind his back, someone\n",
      "was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking\n",
      "of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room.\n",
      "’How is the Dictionary getting on?’ said Winston, raising his voice to over-\n",
      "come the noise.\n",
      "’Slowly,’ said Syme. ’I’m on the adjectives. It’s fascinating.’\n",
      "He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed\n",
      "his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese\n",
      "in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without\n",
      "shouting.\n",
      "’The Eleventh Edition is the deﬁnitive edition,’ he said. ’We’re getting the\n",
      "language into its ﬁnal shape — the shape it’s going to have when nobody speaks\n",
      "anything else. When we’ve ﬁnished with it, people like you will have to learn it\n",
      "all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words.\n",
      "But not a bit of it! We’re destroying words — scores of them, hundreds of them,\n",
      "every day. We’re cutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition\n",
      "won’t contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050.’\n",
      "He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then\n",
      "continued speaking, with a sort of pedant’s passion. His thin dark face had\n",
      "become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost\n",
      "dreamy.\n",
      "’It’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage\n",
      "is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got\n",
      "rid of as well. It isn’t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all,\n",
      "28\n",
      "\n",
      "what justiﬁcation is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other\n",
      "word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take ”good”, for instance. If you\n",
      "have a word like ”good”, what need is there for a word like ”bad”? ”Ungood”\n",
      "will do just as well — better, because it’s an exact opposite, which the other\n",
      "is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of ”good”, what sense is there\n",
      "in having a whole string of vague useless words like ”excellent” and ”splendid”\n",
      "and all the rest of them? ”Plusgood” covers the meaning, or ” doubleplusgood”\n",
      "if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but\n",
      "in the ﬁnal version of Newspeak there’ll be nothing else. In the end the whole\n",
      "notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words — in reality,\n",
      "only one word. Don’t you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.’s idea\n",
      "originally, of course,’ he added as an afterthought.\n",
      "A sort of vapid eagerness ﬂitted across Winston’s face at the mention of Big\n",
      "Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.\n",
      "’You haven’t a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,’ he said almost\n",
      "sadly. ’Even when you write it you’re still thinking in Oldspeak. I’ve read some\n",
      "of those pieces that you write in The Times occasionally. They’re good enough,\n",
      "but they’re translations. In your heart you’d prefer to stick to Oldspeak, with\n",
      "all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You don’t grasp the beauty\n",
      "of the destruction of words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language\n",
      "in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?’\n",
      "Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not\n",
      "trusting himself to speak. Syme bit oﬀanother fragment of the dark-coloured\n",
      "bread, chewed it brieﬂy, and went on:\n",
      "’Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of\n",
      "thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because\n",
      "there will be no words in which to express it.\n",
      "Every concept that can ever\n",
      "be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly\n",
      "deﬁned and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in\n",
      "the Eleventh Edition, we’re not far from that point. But the process will still be\n",
      "continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and\n",
      "the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there’s\n",
      "no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime.\n",
      "It’s merely a question of\n",
      "self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won’t be any need even for\n",
      "that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak\n",
      "is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,’ he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction.\n",
      "’Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest,\n",
      "not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation\n",
      "as we are having now?’\n",
      "’Except-’ began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.\n",
      "It had been on the tip of his tongue to say ’Except the proles,’ but he\n",
      "checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way\n",
      "unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.\n",
      "’The proles are not human beings,’ he said carelessly. ’ By 2050 earlier,\n",
      "probably — all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole\n",
      "literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton,\n",
      "Byron — they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into some-\n",
      "thing diﬀerent, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they\n",
      "used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will\n",
      "change. How could you have a slogan like ”freedom is slavery” when the concept\n",
      "29\n",
      "\n",
      "of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of thought will be diﬀerent.\n",
      "In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means\n",
      "not thinking — not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.’\n",
      "One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will\n",
      "be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.\n",
      "The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear. It is written\n",
      "in his face.\n",
      "Winston had ﬁnished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways in\n",
      "his chair to drink his mug of coﬀee.\n",
      "At the table on his left the man with\n",
      "the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young woman who\n",
      "was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to Winston, was\n",
      "listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said.\n",
      "From time to time Winston caught some such remark as ’I think you’re so right,\n",
      "I do so agree with you’, uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. But\n",
      "the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking.\n",
      "Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than\n",
      "that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man\n",
      "of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head\n",
      "was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his\n",
      "spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of\n",
      "eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured\n",
      "out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just\n",
      "once Winston caught a phrase-’complete and ﬁnal elimination of Goldsteinism’-\n",
      "jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type\n",
      "cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet,\n",
      "though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not\n",
      "be in any doubt about its general nature. He might be denouncing Goldstein\n",
      "and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he\n",
      "might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be\n",
      "praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front-it made no diﬀerence.\n",
      "Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy,\n",
      "pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up\n",
      "and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being\n",
      "but some kind of dummy. It was not the man’s brain that was speaking, it was\n",
      "his larynx. The stuﬀthat was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was\n",
      "not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the\n",
      "quacking of a duck.\n",
      "Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was\n",
      "tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table quacked\n",
      "rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.\n",
      "’There is a word in Newspeak,’ said Syme, ’I don’t know whether you know\n",
      "it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words that\n",
      "have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, applied\n",
      "to someone you agree with, it is praise.’\n",
      "Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought\n",
      "it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and\n",
      "slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-\n",
      "criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong\n",
      "with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort\n",
      "of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in\n",
      "30\n",
      "\n",
      "the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories,\n",
      "he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal,\n",
      "an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary Party member did not\n",
      "approach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things\n",
      "that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented\n",
      "the Chestnut Tree Caf´e, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law,\n",
      "not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Caf´e, yet the\n",
      "place was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had\n",
      "been used to gather there before they were ﬁnally purged. Goldstein himself, it\n",
      "was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme’s fate\n",
      "was not diﬃcult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for\n",
      "three seconds, the nature of his, Winston’s, secret opinions, he would betray him\n",
      "instantly to the Thought police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but\n",
      "Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.\n",
      "Syme looked up. ’Here comes Parsons,’ he said.\n",
      "Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, ’that bloody fool’. Parsons,\n",
      "Winston’s fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way\n",
      "across the room — a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face.\n",
      "At thirty-ﬁve he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his\n",
      "movements were brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy\n",
      "grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it\n",
      "was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts,\n",
      "grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a\n",
      "picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons\n",
      "did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other\n",
      "physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a\n",
      "cheery ’Hullo, hullo!’ and sat down at the table, giving oﬀan intense smell of\n",
      "sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating\n",
      "were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you could always tell when he\n",
      "had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle. Syme had\n",
      "produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was\n",
      "studying it with an ink-pencil between his ﬁngers.\n",
      "’Look at him working away in the lunch hour,’ said Parsons, nudging Win-\n",
      "ston. ’Keenness, eh? What’s that you’ve got there, old boy? Something a bit\n",
      "too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I’ll tell you why I’m chasing you.\n",
      "It’s that sub you forgot to give me.’\n",
      "’Which sub is that? said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About a\n",
      "quarter of one’s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which\n",
      "were so numerous that it was diﬃcult to keep track of them.\n",
      "’For Hate Week. You know — the house-by-house fund. I’m treasurer for\n",
      "our block. We’re making an all-out eﬀort — going to put on a tremendous show.\n",
      "I tell you, it won’t be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn’t have the biggest\n",
      "outﬁt of ﬂags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.’\n",
      "Winston found and handed over two creased and ﬁlthy notes, which Parsons\n",
      "entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.\n",
      "’By the way, old boy,’ he said. ’I hear that little beggar of mine let ﬂy at\n",
      "you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressing-down for it. In fact\n",
      "I told him I’d take the catapult away if he does it again.\n",
      "’I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,’ said Winston.\n",
      "’ Ah, well — what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn’t it? Mis-\n",
      "31\n",
      "\n",
      "chievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness! All they\n",
      "think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D’you know what that little\n",
      "girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted\n",
      "way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped oﬀfrom the hike, and\n",
      "spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They kept on his tail for\n",
      "two hours, right through the woods, and then, when they got into Amersham,\n",
      "handed him over to the patrols.’\n",
      "’What did they do that for?’ said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons\n",
      "went on triumphantly:\n",
      "’My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent — might have been\n",
      "dropped by parachute, for instance. But here’s the point, old boy. What do you\n",
      "think put her on to him in the ﬁrst place? She spotted he was wearing a funny\n",
      "kind of shoes — said she’d never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. So\n",
      "the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?’\n",
      "’What happened to the man?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Ah, that I couldn’t say, of course. But I wouldn’t be altogether surprised\n",
      "if-’ Parsons made the motion of aiming a riﬂe, and clicked his tongue for the\n",
      "explosion.\n",
      "’Good,’ said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.\n",
      "’Of course we can’t aﬀord to take chances,’ agreed Winston dutifully.\n",
      "’What I mean to say, there is a war on,’ said Parsons.\n",
      "As though in conﬁrmation of this, a trumpet call ﬂoated from the telescreen\n",
      "just above their heads.\n",
      "However, it was not the proclamation of a military\n",
      "victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.\n",
      "’Comrades!’ cried an eager youthful voice. ’Attention, comrades! We have\n",
      "glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now\n",
      "completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the\n",
      "standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year. All\n",
      "over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations\n",
      "when workers marched out of factories and oﬃces and paraded through the\n",
      "streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new, happy\n",
      "life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us.\n",
      "Here are some of the\n",
      "completed ﬁgures. Foodstuﬀs-’\n",
      "The phrase ’our new, happy life’ recurred several times.\n",
      "It had been a\n",
      "favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by\n",
      "the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of ediﬁed\n",
      "boredom. He could not follow the ﬁgures, but he was aware that they were in\n",
      "some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and ﬁlthy pipe\n",
      "which was already half full of charred tobacco.\n",
      "With the tobacco ration at\n",
      "100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to ﬁll a pipe to the top. Winston\n",
      "was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new\n",
      "ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the\n",
      "moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the\n",
      "stuﬀthat streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been\n",
      "demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty\n",
      "grammes a week. And only yesterday, he reﬂected, it had been announced that\n",
      "the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that\n",
      "they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it.\n",
      "Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature\n",
      "at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire\n",
      "32\n",
      "\n",
      "to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last\n",
      "week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too-in some more complex\n",
      "way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it.\n",
      "Was he, then, alone in the\n",
      "possession of a memory?\n",
      "The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As compared\n",
      "with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture,\n",
      "more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more\n",
      "babies — more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. Year by year\n",
      "and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards.\n",
      "As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling\n",
      "in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak\n",
      "of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of\n",
      "life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked\n",
      "round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the\n",
      "contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close\n",
      "together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse\n",
      "white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite\n",
      "smell of bad gin and bad coﬀee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in\n",
      "your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you\n",
      "had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had\n",
      "no memories of anything greatly diﬀerent. In any time that he could accurately\n",
      "remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks\n",

      "On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like\n",

      "side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you,\n",

      "youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree —\n",
      "existed and even predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority\n",
      "of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how\n",
      "that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing\n",
      "stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat\n",
      "inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to ﬂourish\n",
      "best under the dominion of the Party.\n",
      "The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet\n",
      "call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the\n",
      "bombardment of ﬁgures, took his pipe out of his mouth.\n",
      "’The Ministry of Plenty’s certainly done a good job this year,’ he said with\n",
      "a knowing shake of his head. ’By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven’t\n",
      "33\n",
      "\n",
      "got any razor blades you can let me have?’\n",
      "’Not one,’ said Winston.\n",

      "myself.’\n",
      "’Ah, well — just thought I’d ask you, old boy.’\n",
      "’Sorry,’ said Winston.\n",
      "The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the\n",
      "Ministry’s announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some reason\n",
      "Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair\n",
      "and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those children would be\n",
      "denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme\n",
      "would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O’Brien would be vaporized.\n",
      "Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. The eyeless creature\n",
      "with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men\n",
      "who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries they, too,\n",
      "would never be vaporized. And the girl with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction\n",

      "knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what\n",
      "it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say.\n",
      "At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The\n",
      "girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It was\n",
      "the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with\n",
      "curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.\n",
      "The sweat started out on Winston’s backbone. A horrible pang of terror\n",
      "went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging\n",
      "uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following\n",
      "him about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been\n",
      "at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at\n",
      "any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him\n",
      "when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had been\n",
      "to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.\n",
      "His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member\n",
      "of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the\n",
      "greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking at him,\n",
      "but perhaps for as much as ﬁve minutes, and it was possible that his features had\n",
      "not been perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts\n",
      "wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen.\n",
      "The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of\n",
      "anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself — anything that carried with it the\n",
      "suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear\n",
      "an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was\n",
      "announced, for example) was itself a punishable oﬀence. There was even a word\n",
      "for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.\n",
      "The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not\n",
      "really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close\n",
      "to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on\n",
      "the edge of the table. He would ﬁnish smoking it after work, if he could keep the\n",
      "tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought\n",
      "Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within\n",
      "three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his\n",

      "It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near\n",
      "one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a doorway in the wall,\n",
      "under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted\n",
      "very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like\n",
      "a mask, and the bright red lips. Party women never paint their faces. There\n",
      "was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I\n",
      "For the moment it was too diﬃcult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed\n",
      "his ﬁngers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring.\n",
      "He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of ﬁlthy words\n",
      "at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the\n",
      "table, and hurl the inkpot through the window — to do any violent or noisy or\n",
      "painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.\n",
      "Your worst enemy, he reﬂected, was your own nervous system. At any mo-\n",
      "ment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symp-\n",
      "tom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back;\n",
      "a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-ﬁve to forty, tallish\n",
      "and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres apart when the left side\n",
      "of the man’s face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again\n",
      "just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid\n",
      "as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered\n",
      "thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening\n",
      "was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of\n",
      "all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of guarding against that, so far\n",
      "as he could see.\n",
      "He drew his breath and went on writing:\n",
      "I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement\n",
      "kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned\n",
      "down very low. She\n",
      "His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously\n",
      "with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.\n",
      "Winston was married — had been married, at any rate: probably he still was\n",
      "married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe again\n",
      "the warm stuﬀy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs\n",
      "and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because\n",
      "no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only\n",
      "the proles used scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up\n",
      "36\n",
      "\n",
      "with fornication.\n",
      "When he had gone with that woman it had been his ﬁrst lapse in two years\n",
      "or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it\n",
      "was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. It\n",
      "was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught with a\n",
      "prostitute might mean ﬁve years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had\n",
      "committed no other oﬀence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could\n",
      "avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who\n",
      "were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of\n",
      "gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even\n",
      "inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not\n",
      "be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long\n",
      "as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and\n",
      "despised class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members.\n",
      "But — though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges\n",
      "invariably confessed to — it was diﬃcult to imagine any such thing actually\n",
      "happening.\n",
      "The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from\n",
      "forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared\n",
      "purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as\n",
      "eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages\n",

      "always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically\n",
      "attracted to one another. The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget\n",
      "children for the service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as\n",
      "a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was\n",
      "never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every\n",
      "Party member from childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as\n",
      "the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes.\n",
      "All children were to be begotten by artiﬁcial insemination (artsem, it was called\n",
      "in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston was aware,\n",
      "was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it ﬁtted in with the general\n",
      "ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it\n",
      "could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why this\n",
      "was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And as far as the women\n",
      "were concerned, the Party’s eﬀorts were largely successful.\n",
      "He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten — nearly eleven years\n",
      "since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For days\n",
      "at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had\n",
      "only been together for about ﬁfteen months. The Party did not permit divorce,\n",
      "but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.\n",
      "Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements.\n",
      "She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one\n",
      "discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very early in\n",
      "her married life he had decided — though perhaps it was only that he knew her\n",
      "more intimately than he knew most people — that she had without exception\n",
      "the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had\n",
      "not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility,\n",
      "absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it\n",
      "37\n",
      "\n",
      "out to her. ’The human sound-track’ he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet\n",
      "he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing —\n",
      "sex.\n",
      "As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiﬀen. To embrace\n",
      "her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was\n",
      "that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she\n",
      "was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidlty of\n",
      "her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there with shut\n",
      "eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting. It was extraordinarily\n",
      "embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he could have borne\n",
      "living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But\n",
      "curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.\n",
      "They must, she said,\n",
      "produce a child if they could. So the performance continued to happen, once a\n",
      "week quite regulariy, whenever it was not impossible. She even used to remind\n",
      "him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and\n",
      "which must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. One was ’making a\n",
      "baby’, and the other was ’our duty to the Party’ (yes, she had actually used\n",
      "that phrase). Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the\n",
      "appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she\n",
      "agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted.\n",
      "Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and wrote:\n",
      "She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of pre-\n",
      "liminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt.\n",
      "I\n",
      "He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs\n",
      "and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment\n",
      "which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine’s white\n",
      "body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did it always\n",
      "have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of\n",
      "these ﬁlthy scuﬄes at intervals of years? But a real love aﬀair was an almost\n",
      "unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deep\n",
      "ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and\n",
      "cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies\n",
      "and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music,\n",
      "the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there\n",
      "must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable,\n",
      "as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even\n",
      "than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once\n",
      "in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire\n",
      "was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved\n",
      "it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife.\n",
      "But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:\n",
      "I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light\n",
      "After the darkness the feeble light of the paraﬃn lamp had seemed very\n",
      "bright. For the ﬁrst time he could see the woman properly. He had taken a step\n",
      "towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious\n",
      "of the risk he had taken in coming here.\n",
      "It was perfectly possible that the\n",
      "patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter they might be waiting\n",
      "outside the door at this moment. If he went away without even doing what he\n",
      "had come here to do — !\n",
      "38\n",
      "\n",
      "It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had\n",
      "suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. The paint was\n",
      "plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a\n",
      "cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful\n",
      "detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a\n",
      "cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.\n",
      "He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:\n",
      "When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, ﬁfty years old at\n",
      "least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.\n",
      "He pressed his ﬁngers against his eyelids again. He had written it down at\n",
      "last, but it made no diﬀerence. The therapy had not worked. The urge to shout\n",

      "a deep, loud ’Oh-o-o-o-oh!’ that went humming on like the reverberation of a\n",

      "ship.\n",
      "But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude\n",
      "of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin\n",
      "saucepans. They were wretched, ﬂimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind\n",
      "were always diﬃcult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The\n",

      "their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the\n",
      "stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve.\n",
      "There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her\n",

      "it out of one another’s hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then\n",

      "Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have\n",
      "rebelled they cannot become conscious.\n",
      "That, he reﬂected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the\n",
      "Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles\n",

      "in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact),\n",
      "children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously,\n",
      "true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were\n",

      "of a few simple rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It was\n",

      "There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise even\n",

      "Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The Times. They\n",

      "have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging,\n",
      "falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one’s eyes,\n",

      "changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into it — but\n",
      "it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering\n",

      "time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what\n",
      "he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.\n",
      "A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had engaged\n",
      "in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At their second\n",
      "trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new\n",
      "ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a\n",
      "warning to posterity. About ﬁve years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling\n",
      "a wad of documents which had just ﬂopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his\n",
      "desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped\n",
      "in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had ﬂattened it out\n",
      "he saw its signiﬁcance. It was a half-page torn out of The Times of about ten\n",
      "years earlier — the top half of the page, so that it included the date — and it\n",
      "contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York.\n",
      "Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford.\n",
      "There was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at\n",
      "the bottom.\n",
      "The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that\n",
      "date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had ﬂown from a secret airﬁeld in\n",
      "Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members\n",
      "44\n",
      "\n",
      "of the Eurasian General Staﬀ, to whom they had betrayed important military\n",
      "secrets. The date had stuck in Winston’s memory because it chanced to be\n",
      "midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other\n",
      "places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were\n",
      "lies.\n",
      "Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston had\n",
      "not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually\n",
      "committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence;\n",
      "it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the\n",
      "wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the\n",
      "Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and\n",
      "its signiﬁcance made known.\n",
      "He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph\n",
      "was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.\n",
      "Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of\n",
      "the telescreen.\n",
      "He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get\n",
      "as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was\n",
      "not diﬃcult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an eﬀort: but you\n",
      "could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate\n",
      "enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented\n",
      "all the while by the fear that some accident — a sudden draught blowing across\n",
      "his desk, for instance — would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again,\n",
      "he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste\n",
      "papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.\n",
      "That was ten — eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that\n",
      "photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his ﬁngers seemed\n",
      "to him to make a diﬀerence even now, when the photograph itself, as well as\n",
      "the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party’s hold upon the past\n",
      "less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer\n",
      "had once existed?\n",
      "But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes,\n",
      "the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he made\n",
      "his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been\n",
      "to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country.\n",
      "Since then there had been other changes — two, three, he could not remember\n",
      "how many. Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until\n",
      "the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest signiﬁcance. The past not\n",
      "only changed, but changed continuously. What most aﬄicted him with the sense\n",
      "of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture\n",
      "was undertaken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious,\n",
      "but the ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:\n",
      "I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\n",
      "He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself\n",
      "was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At one time it\n",
      "had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today,\n",
      "to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be alone in holding that belief,\n",
      "and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly\n",

      "out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses.\n",
      "In the end the Party would announce that two and two made ﬁve, and you\n",
      "would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim\n",
      "sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity\n",
      "of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by\n",
      "their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was\n",
      "terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they\n",
      "might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four?\n",
      "Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both\n",

      "who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years’ time, and old bent\n",
      "creatures shuﬄing along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who\n",
      "played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.\n",
      "Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.\n",
      "Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort\n",
      "47\n",
      "\n",
      "of guarded curiosity.\n",
      "Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded\n",
      "across thelr aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught scraps of\n",
      "conversation as he approached.\n",
      "’ ”Yes,” I says to ’er, ”that’s all very well,” I says. ”But if you’d of been in\n",
      "my place you’d of done the same as what I done. It’s easy to criticize,” I says,\n",
      "”but you ain’t got the same problems as what I got.” ’\n",
      "’Ah,’ said the other, ’that’s jest it. That’s jest where it is.’\n",
      "The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile\n",
      "silence as he went past.\n",
      "But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of\n",
      "wariness, a momentary stiﬀening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal.\n",
      "The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this.\n",
      "Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had deﬁnite business\n",
      "there. The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. ’May I\n",
      "see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did you leave\n",
      "work? Is this your usual way home?’ — and so on and so forth. Not that there\n",
      "was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to\n",
      "draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.\n",
      "Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning\n",
      "from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A young\n",
      "woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny\n",
      "child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again,\n",
      "all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit,\n",
      "who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to\n",
      "the sky.\n",
      "’Steamer!’ he yelled. ’Look out, guv’nor! Bang over’ead! Lay down quick!’\n",
      "’Steamer’ was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to\n",
      "rocket bombs. Winston promptly ﬂung himself on his face. The proles were\n",
      "nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed to\n",
      "possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a\n",
      "rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound.\n",
      "Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar that seemed\n",
      "to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back.\n",
      "When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from\n",
      "the nearest window.\n",
      "He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up\n",
      "the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of\n",
      "plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was\n",
      "a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of\n",
      "it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it was a\n",
      "human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was\n",
      "so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.\n",
      "He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned\n",
      "down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out of the\n",
      "area which the bomb had aﬀected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets\n",
      "was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours, and\n",
      "the drinking-shops which the proles frequented (’pubs’, they called them) were\n",
      "choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and\n",
      "shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle\n",
      "formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together,\n",
      "the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were\n",
      "48\n",
      "\n",
      "studying over his shoulder. Even before he was near enough to make out the\n",
      "expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their\n",
      "bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He\n",
      "was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of\n",
      "the men were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the\n",
      "point of blows.\n",
      "’Can’t you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending\n",
      "in seven ain’t won for over fourteen months!’\n",
      "’Yes, it ’as, then!’\n",
      "’No, it ’as not! Back ’ome I got the ’ole lot of ’em for over two years wrote\n",
      "down on a piece of paper. I takes ’em down reg’lar as the clock. An’ I tell you,\n",
      "no number ending in seven-’\n",
      "’Yes, a seven ’as won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. Four\n",
      "oh seven, it ended in. It were in February — second week in February.’\n",
      "’February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An’ I tell\n",
      "you, no number-’\n",
      "’Oh, pack it in!’ said the third man.\n",
      "They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had\n",
      "gone thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. The\n",
      "Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event\n",
      "to which the proles paid serious attention.\n",
      "It was probable that there were\n",
      "some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only\n",
      "reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their\n",
      "intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could\n",
      "barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering\n",
      "feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply\n",
      "by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do\n",
      "with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty,\n",
      "but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were\n",
      "largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big\n",
      "prizes being non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication\n",
      "between one part of Oceania and another, this was not diﬃcult to arrange.\n",
      "But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that.\n",
      "When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at\n",
      "the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith.\n",
      "The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he\n",
      "had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare\n",
      "not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. The\n",
      "street took a sharp turn and then ended in a ﬂight of steps which led down into\n",
      "a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables.\n",
      "At this moment Winston remembered where he was. The alley led out into\n",
      "the main street, and down the next turning, not ﬁve minutes away, was the\n",
      "junk-shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. And\n",
      "in a small stationer’s shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his\n",
      "bottle of ink.\n",
      "He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of the\n",
      "alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but\n",
      "in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active, with\n",
      "white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the\n",
      "swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it occurred to him that\n",
      "49\n",
      "\n",
      "the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged\n",
      "when the Revolution happened. He and a few others like him were the last links\n",
      "that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there\n",
      "were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution.\n",
      "The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the\n",
      "ﬁfties and sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terriﬁed into\n",
      "complete intellectual surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give\n",
      "you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could\n",
      "only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied\n",
      "into his diary came back into Winston’s mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold\n",
      "of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old\n",
      "man and question him. He would say to him: ’Tell me about your life when you\n",
      "were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better than they are\n",
      "now, or were they worse?’\n",
      "Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the\n",
      "steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual, there\n",
      "was no deﬁnite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but\n",
      "it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the patrols appeared he\n",
      "might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe\n",
      "him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him\n",
      "in the face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume.\n",
      "Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts\n",
      "which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps\n",
      "as much as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing\n",
      "at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout,\n",
      "hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing\n",
      "round with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.\n",
      "’I arst you civil enough, didn’t I?’ said the old man, straightening his shoul-\n",
      "ders pugnaciously. ’You telling me you ain’t got a pint mug in the ’ole bleeding\n",
      "boozer?’\n",
      "’And what in hell’s name is a pint?’ said the barman, leaning forward with\n",
      "the tips of his ﬁngers on the counter.\n",
      "’Ark at ’im! Calls ’isself a barman and don’t know what a pint is! Why, a\n",
      "pint’s the ’alf of a quart, and there’s four quarts to the gallon. ’Ave to teach\n",
      "you the A, B, C next.’\n",
      "’Never heard of ’em,’ said the barman shortly. ’Litre and half litre — that’s\n",
      "all we serve. There’s the glasses on the shelf in front of you.\n",
      "’I likes a pint,’ persisted the old man. ’You could ’a drawed me oﬀa pint\n",
      "easy enough. We didn’t ’ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.’\n",
      "’When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,’ said the\n",
      "barman, with a glance at the other customers.\n",
      "There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston’s entry\n",
      "seemed to disappear. The old man’s whitestubbled face had ﬂushed pink. He\n",
      "turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught\n",
      "him gently by the arm.\n",
      "’May I oﬀer you a drink?’ he said.\n",
      "’You’re a gent,’ said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He ap-\n",
      "peared not to have noticed Winston’s blue overalls. ’Pint!’ he added aggressively\n",
      "to the barman. ’Pint of wallop.’\n",
      "The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses\n",
      "50\n",
      "\n",
      "which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink you\n",
      "could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in\n",
      "practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was in full\n",
      "swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery\n",
      "tickets. Winston’s presence was forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table\n",
      "under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being\n",
      "overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen\n",
      "in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.\n",
      "”E could ’a drawed me oﬀa pint,’ grumbled the old man as he settled down\n",
      "behind a glass. ’A ’alf litre ain’t enough. It don’t satisfy. And a ’ole litre’s too\n",
      "much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price.’\n",
      "’You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,’ said Win-\n",
      "ston tentatively.\n",
      "The old man’s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and\n",
      "from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room that\n",
      "he expected the changes to have occurred.\n",
      "’The beer was better,’ he said ﬁnally. ’And cheaper! When I was a young\n",
      "man, mild beer — wallop we used to call it — was fourpence a pint. That was\n",
      "before the war, of course.’\n",
      "’Which war was that?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’It’s all wars,’ said the old man vaguely.\n",
      "He took up his glass, and his\n",
      "shoulders straightened again. ”Ere’s wishing you the very best of ’ealth!’\n",
      "In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam’s apple made a surprisingly rapid\n",
      "up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and\n",
      "came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten\n",
      "his prejudice against drinking a full litre.\n",
      "’You are very much older than I am,’ said Winston. ’You must have been a\n",
      "grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old\n",
      "days, before the Revolution. People of my age don’t really know anything about\n",
      "those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says in the\n",
      "books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The history books\n",
      "say that life before the Revolution was completely diﬀerent from what it is now.\n",
      "There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything\n",
      "we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough\n",
      "to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn’t even boots on their feet. They\n",
      "worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room.\n",
      "And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands —\n",
      "the capitalists, they were called — who were rich and powerful. They owned\n",
      "everything that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with\n",
      "thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they\n",
      "drank champagne, they wore top hats-’\n",
      "The old man brightened suddenly.\n",
      "’Top ’ats!’ he said. ’Funny you should mention ’em. The same thing come\n",
      "into my ’ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain’t seen a top\n",
      "’at in years. Gorn right out, they ’ave. The last time I wore one was at my\n",
      "sister-in-law’s funeral. And that was — well, I couldn’t give you the date, but\n",
      "it must’a been ﬁfty years ago. Of course it was only ’ired for the occasion, you\n",
      "understand.’\n",
      "’It isn’t very important about the top hats,’ said Winston patiently. ’The\n",
      "point is, these capitalists — they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth\n",
      "51\n",
      "\n",
      "who lived on them — were the lords of the earth. Everything existed for their\n",
      "beneﬁt. You — the ordinary people, the workers — were their slaves. They\n",
      "could do what they liked with you. They could ship you oﬀto Canada like\n",
      "cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose. They could order\n",
      "you to be ﬂogged with something called a cat-o’-nine tails. You had to take\n",
      "your cap oﬀwhen you passed them. Every capitalist went about with a gang of\n",
      "lackeys who-’\n",
      "The old man brightened again.\n",
      "’Lackeys!’ he said. ’Now there’s a word I ain’t ’eard since ever so long.\n",
      "Lackeys! That reg’lar takes me back, that does. I recollect oh, donkey’s years\n",
      "ago — I used to sometimes go to ’Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ’ear the\n",
      "blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians — all\n",
      "sorts there was. And there was one bloke — well, I couldn’t give you ’is name,\n",
      "but a real powerful speaker ’e was. ’E didn’t ’alf give it ’em! ”Lackeys!” ’e says,\n",
      "”lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of the ruling class!” Parasites — that was\n",
      "another of them. And ’yenas — ’e deﬁnitely called ’em ’yenas. Of course ’e was\n",
      "referring to the Labour Party, you understand.’\n",
      "Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross-purposes.\n",
      "’What I really wanted to know was this,’ he said. ’Do you feel that you have\n",
      "more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more like a\n",
      "human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the top-’\n",
      "’The ’Ouse of Lords,’ put in the old man reminiscently.\n",
      "’The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people able\n",
      "to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you were poor?\n",
      "Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them ”Sir” and take oﬀyour cap\n",
      "when you passed them?’\n",
      "The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank oﬀabout a quarter of his\n",
      "beer before answering.\n",
      "’Yes,’ he said. ’They liked you to touch your cap to ’em. It showed respect,\n",
      "like. I didn’t agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough. Had to, as you\n",
      "might say.’\n",
      "’And was it usual — I’m only quoting what I’ve read in history books —\n",
      "was it usual for these people and their servants to push you oﬀthe pavement\n",
      "into the gutter?’\n",
      "’One of ’em pushed me once,’ said the old man. ’I recollect it as if it was\n",
      "yesterday. It was Boat Race night — terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat\n",
      "Race night — and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite\n",
      "a gent, ’e was — dress shirt, top ’at, black overcoat. ’E was kind of zig-zagging\n",
      "across the pavement, and I bumps into ’im accidental-like. ’E says, ”Why can’t\n",

      "An’ if you’ll believe me, ’e puts ’is ’and on my chest and gives me a shove as\n",
      "pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days,\n",
      "and I was going to ’ave fetched ’im one, only-’\n",
      "A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man’s memory was\n",
      "nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day without\n",
      "getting any real information. The party histories might still be true, after a\n",
      "fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last attempt.\n",
      "52\n",
      "\n",
      "’Perhaps I have not made myself clear,’ he said. ’What I’m trying to say is\n",
      "this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before the\n",
      "Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up. Would you say\n",
      "from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is now, or\n",
      "worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live then or now?’\n",
      "The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He ﬁnished up his beer,\n",
      "more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical\n",
      "air, as though the beer had mellowed him.\n",
      "’I know what you expect me to say,’ he said. ’You expect me to say as I’d\n",
      "sooner be young again. Most people’d say they’d sooner be young, if you arst’\n",
      "’em. You got your ’ealth and strength when you’re young. When you get to\n",
      "my time of life you ain’t never well. I suﬀer something wicked from my feet,\n",
      "and my bladder’s jest terrible. Six and seven times a night it ’as me out of bed.\n",
      "On the other ’and, there’s great advantages in being a old man. You ain’t got\n",
      "the same worries. No truck with women, and that’s a great thing. I ain’t ’ad a\n",
      "woman for near on thirty year, if you’d credit it. Nor wanted to, what’s more.’\n",
      "Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was\n",
      "about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuﬄed\n",
      "rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was\n",
      "already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty\n",
      "glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again.\n",
      "Within twenty years at the most, he reﬂected, the huge and simple question,\n",
      "’Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?’ would have ceased once\n",
      "and for all to be answerable. But in eﬀect it was unanswerable even now, since\n",
      "the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing\n",
      "one age with another.\n",
      "They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel\n",
      "with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead\n",
      "sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all\n",
      "the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant,\n",
      "which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and\n",
      "written records were falsiﬁed — when that happened, the claim of the Party\n",
      "to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because\n",
      "there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it\n",
      "could be tested.\n",
      "At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked\n",
      "up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among\n",
      "dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal\n",
      "balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed to know the\n",
      "place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought\n",
      "the diary.\n",
      "A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a suﬃciently rash act to buy\n",
      "the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again.\n",
      "And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought\n",
      "him back here of their own accord. It was precisely against suicidal impulses of\n",
      "this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. At the same\n",
      "time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still\n",
      "open. With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging\n",
      "about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway.\n",
      "If questioned, he\n",
      "could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.\n",
      "The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave oﬀan unclean\n",
      "53\n",
      "\n",
      "but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long,\n",
      "benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles.\n",
      "His hair was\n",
      "almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His spectacles, his\n",
      "gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of\n",
      "black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he had been some\n",
      "kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded,\n",
      "and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles.\n",
      "’I recognized you on the pavement,’ he said immediately. ’You’re the gentle-\n",
      "man that bought the young lady’s keepsake album. That was a beautiful bit of\n",
      "paper, that was. Cream- laid, it used to be called. There’s been no paper like\n",
      "that made for — oh, I dare say ﬁfty years.’ He peered at Winston over the top\n",
      "of his spectacles. ’Is there anything special I can do for you? Or did you just\n",
      "want to look round?’\n",
      "’I was passing,’ said Winston vaguely. ’I just looked in. I don’t want anything\n",
      "in particular.’\n",
      "’It’s just as well,’ said the other, ’because I don’t suppose I could have sat-\n",
      "isﬁed you.’ He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand. ’You see\n",
      "how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the antique\n",
      "trade’s just about ﬁnished. No demand any longer, and no stock either. Furni-\n",
      "ture, china, glass it’s all been broken up by degrees. And of course the metal\n",
      "stuﬀ’s mostly been melted down. I haven’t seen a brass candlestick in years.’\n",
      "The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was\n",
      "almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The ﬂoorspace was very restricted,\n",
      "because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames. In\n",
      "the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with\n",
      "broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order,\n",
      "and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner was there a\n",
      "litter of odds and ends — lacquered snuﬀboxes, agate brooches, and the like —\n",
      "which looked as though they might include something interesting. As Winston\n",
      "wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that\n",
      "gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up.\n",
      "It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, ﬂat on the other, making\n",
      "almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the\n",
      "colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magniﬁed by the curved\n",
      "surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a\n",
      "sea anemone.\n",
      "’What is it?’ said Winston, fascinated.\n",
      "’That’s coral, that is,’ said the old man. ’It must have come from the Indian\n",
      "Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn’t made less than\n",
      "a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.’\n",
      "’It’s a beautiful thing,’ said Winston.\n",
      "’It is a beautiful thing,’ said the other appreciatively. ’But there’s not many\n",
      "that’d say so nowadays.’ He coughed. ’Now, if it so happened that you wanted\n",
      "to buy it, that’d cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing like that\n",
      "would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was — well, I can’t work it\n",
      "out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays\n",
      "even the few that’s left?’\n",
      "Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing\n",
      "into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty\n",
      "as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite diﬀerent from the\n",
      "54\n",
      "\n",
      "present one.\n",
      "The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had\n",
      "ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness,\n",
      "though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight.\n",
      "It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge.\n",
      "It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have\n",
      "in his possession. Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was\n",
      "always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after\n",
      "receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted three\n",
      "or even two.\n",
      "’There’s another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,’ he\n",
      "said. ’There’s not much in it. Just a few pieces. We’ll do with a light if we’re\n",
      "going upstairs.’\n",
      "He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep\n",
      "and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the\n",
      "street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots. Winston\n",
      "noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to\n",
      "be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the ﬂoor, a picture or two on the walls,\n",
      "and a deep, slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the ﬁreplace. An old-fashioned\n",
      "glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under\n",
      "the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed\n",
      "with the mattress still on it.\n",
      "’We lived here till my wife died,’ said the old man half apologetically. ’I’m\n",
      "selling the furniture oﬀby little and little. Now that’s a beautiful mahogany\n",
      "bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say\n",
      "you’d ﬁnd it a little bit cumbersome.\n",
      "He was holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and\n",
      "in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought ﬂitted\n",
      "through Winston’s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room\n",
      "for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible\n",
      "notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in\n",
      "him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he\n",
      "knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside\n",
      "an open ﬁre with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone,\n",
      "utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound\n",
      "except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.\n",
      "’There’s no telescreen!’ he could not help murmuring.\n",
      "’Ah,’ said the old man, ’I never had one of those things. Too expensive. And\n",
      "I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that’s a nice gateleg table\n",
      "in the corner there. Though of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you\n",
      "wanted to use the ﬂaps.’\n",
      "There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already\n",
      "gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and\n",
      "destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole\n",
      "quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in\n",
      "Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying\n",
      "the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on\n",
      "the other side of the ﬁreplace, opposite the bed.\n",
      "’Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all -’ he began delicately.\n",
      "Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of\n",
      "an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There\n",
      "55\n",
      "\n",
      "was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what\n",
      "appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed\n",
      "vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.\n",
      "’The frame’s ﬁxed to the wall,’ said the old man, ’but I could unscrew it for\n",
      "you, I dare say.’\n",
      "’I know that building,’ said Winston ﬁnally. ’It’s a ruin now. It’s in the\n",
      "middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.’\n",
      "’That’s right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in — oh, many years\n",
      "ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement’s Danes, its name was.’ He smiled\n",
      "apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and\n",
      "added: ’Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s!’\n",
      "’What’s that?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Oh-”Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s.” That was a rhyme\n",
      "we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don’t remember, but I do know\n",
      "it ended up, ”Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper\n",
      "to chop oﬀyour head.” It was a kind of a dance. They held out their arms for\n",
      "you to pass under, and when they came to ”Here comes a chopper to chop oﬀ\n",
      "your head” they brought their arms down and caught you. It was just names of\n",
      "churches. All the London churches were in it — all the principal ones, that is.’\n",
      "Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was\n",
      "always diﬃcult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and\n",
      "impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed\n",
      "as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously\n",
      "of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages. The\n",
      "centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. One\n",
      "could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from\n",
      "books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets — anything\n",
      "that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.\n",
      "’I never knew it had been a church,’ he said.\n",
      "’There’s a lot of them left, really,’ said the old man, ’though they’ve been\n",
      "put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I’ve got it!\n",
      "”Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s,\n",
      "You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s\n",
      "— ”there, now, that’s as far as I can get.\n",
      "A farthing, that was a small copper coin,\n",
      "looked something like a cent.’\n",
      "’Where was St Martin’s?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’St Martin’s? That’s still standing. It’s in Victory Square, alongside the\n",
      "picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front,\n",
      "and a big ﬂight of steps.’\n",
      "Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda dis-\n",
      "plays of various kinds — scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses,\n",
      "waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.\n",
      "’St Martin’s-in-the-Fields it used to be called,’ supplemented the old man,\n",
      "’though I don’t recollect any ﬁelds anywhere in those parts.’\n",
      "Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more incon-\n",
      "gruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home,\n",
      "unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more,\n",
      "talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks-as one might\n",
      "have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front — but Charrington. Mr\n",
      "56\n",
      "\n",
      "Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this\n",
      "shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the\n",
      "name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it. All the\n",
      "while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through\n",
      "Winston’s head. Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clement’s, You owe me\n",
      "three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s! It was curious, but when you said\n",
      "it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost\n",
      "London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From\n",
      "one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so\n",
      "far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.\n",
      "He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as\n",
      "not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of\n",
      "the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval — a\n",
      "month, say — he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. It was perhaps\n",
      "not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The serious piece\n",
      "of folly had been to come back here in the ﬁrst place, after buying the diary and\n",
      "without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. However-!\n",
      "Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of\n",
      "beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement’s Danes, take it\n",
      "out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls.\n",
      "He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington’s memory. Even\n",
      "the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs ﬂashed momentarily through\n",
      "his mind again. For perhaps ﬁve seconds exaltation made him careless, and\n",
      "he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance\n",
      "through the window. He had even started humming to an improvised tune\n",
      "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s, You owe me three far-\n",
      "things, say the\n",
      "Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A ﬁgure\n",
      "in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was\n",
      "the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was\n",
      "failing, but there was no diﬃculty in recognizing her. She looked him straight\n",
      "in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him.\n",
      "For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to\n",
      "the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was\n",
      "going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was\n",
      "no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have followed\n",
      "him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have\n",
      "happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet,\n",
      "kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived. It was too\n",
      "great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police,\n",
      "or simply an amateur spy actuated by oﬃciousness, hardly mattered. It was\n",
      "enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go into the pub\n",
      "as well.\n",
      "It was an eﬀort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his\n",
      "thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away.\n",
      "The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the\n",
      "feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But there would\n",
      "be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the spasm passed, leaving a\n",
      "dull ache behind.\n",
      "The street was a blind alley.\n",
      "Winston halted, stood for several seconds\n",
      "57\n",
      "\n",
      "wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his\n",
      "steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three\n",
      "minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could\n",
      "keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull\n",
      "in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough\n",
      "for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought\n",
      "of making any physical eﬀort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not\n",
      "strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He\n",
      "thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the\n",
      "place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was\n",
      "impossible. A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get\n",
      "home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.\n",
      "It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the ﬂat. The lights would\n",
      "be switched oﬀat the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the kitchen and\n",
      "swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the\n",
      "alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did not open\n",
      "it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic\n",
      "song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success\n",
      "to shut the voice out of his consciousness.\n",
      "It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing\n",
      "was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so. Many\n",
      "of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage\n",
      "to kill yourself in a world where ﬁrearms, or any quick and certain poison,\n",
      "were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of astonishment of the\n",
      "biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which\n",
      "always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special eﬀort is needed.\n",
      "He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough:\n",
      "but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act.\n",
      "It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never ﬁghting against an external\n",
      "enemy, but always against one’s own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the\n",
      "dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same,\n",
      "he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the battleﬁeld,\n",
      "in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are ﬁghting for\n",
      "are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it ﬁlls the universe, and\n",
      "even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a\n",
      "moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a\n",
      "sour stomach or an aching tooth.\n",
      "He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman\n",
      "on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into his\n",
      "brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O’Brien, for whom, or\n",
      "to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things\n",
      "that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away. It would\n",
      "not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was what you expected. But\n",
      "before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there\n",
      "was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the\n",
      "ﬂoor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth,\n",
      "and bloody clots of hair.\n",
      "Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was\n",
      "it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped\n",
      "detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had succumbed to\n",

      "thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. Why then\n",
      "did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?\n",

      "said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where\n",

      "But with the voice\n",
      "from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought\n",

      "her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth\n",
      "stood out redder than ever.\n",
      "Her eyes were ﬁxed on his, with an appealing\n",
      "expression that looked more like fear than pain.\n",
      "A curious emotion stirred in Winston’s heart. In front of him was an enemy\n",
      "who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain\n",
      "and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward\n",
      "to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it\n",
      "had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.\n",
      "’You’re hurt?’ he said.\n",
      "’It’s nothing. My arm. It’ll be all right in a second.’\n",
      "She spoke as though her heart were ﬂuttering. She had certainly turned very\n",
      "pale.\n",
      "’You haven’t broken anything?’\n",
      "’No, I’m all right. It hurt for a moment, that’s all.’\n",
      "She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained\n",
      "some of her colour, and appeared very much better.\n",
      "’It’s nothing,’ she repeated shortly. ’I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.\n",
      "Thanks, comrade!’\n",
      "And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as\n",
      "briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could not have\n",
      "taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one’s feelings appear in one’s face was\n",
      "a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been\n",
      "standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless\n",
      "it had been very diﬃcult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two\n",
      "or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something\n",
      "60\n",
      "\n",
      "into his hand. There was no question that she had done it intentionally. It was\n",
      "something small and ﬂat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred\n",
      "it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his ﬁngers. It was a scrap of paper\n",
      "folded into a square.\n",
      "While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more ﬁngering, to\n",
      "get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on\n",
      "it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and\n",
      "read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was\n",
      "no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched\n",
      "continuously.\n",
      "He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually\n",
      "among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the\n",
      "speakwrite towards him. ’ﬁve minutes,’ he told himself, ’ﬁve minutes at the very\n",
      "least!’ His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately\n",
      "the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectiﬁcation of a\n",
      "long list of ﬁgures, not needing close attention.\n",
      "Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political\n",
      "meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much the\n",
      "more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had\n",
      "feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their\n",
      "messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. The thing that\n",
      "was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit\n",
      "suicide, a trap of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility\n",
      "that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that\n",
      "the message did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of\n",
      "underground organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps\n",
      "the girl was part of it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his\n",
      "mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a\n",
      "couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred\n",
      "to him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably\n",
      "meant death — still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope\n",
      "persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with diﬃculty that he kept his voice\n",
      "from trembling as he murmured his ﬁgures into the speakwrite.\n",
      "He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic\n",
      "tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose,\n",
      "sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper\n",
      "on top of it.\n",
      "He ﬂattened it out.\n",
      "On it was written, in a large unformed\n",
      "handwriting:\n",
      "I love you.\n",
      "For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing\n",
      "into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the danger\n",
      "of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to\n",
      "make sure that the words were really there.\n",
      "For the rest of the morning it was very diﬃcult to work. What was even\n",
      "worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to\n",
      "conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a ﬁre were burning\n",
      "in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-ﬁlled canteen was torment. He\n",
      "had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck\n",
      "would have it the imbecile Parsons ﬂopped down beside him, the tang of his\n",
      "sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk\n",
      "61\n",
      "\n",
      "about the preparations for Hate Week. He was particularly enthusiastic about\n",
      "a papier-mˆach´e; model of Big Brother’s head, two metres wide, which was being\n",
      "made for the occasion by his daughter’s troop of Spies. The irritating thing was\n",
      "that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying,\n",
      "and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just\n",
      "once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far\n",
      "end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in\n",
      "that direction again.\n",
      "The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a\n",
      "delicate, diﬃcult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated\n",
      "putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production\n",
      "reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent\n",
      "member of the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud. This was the kind\n",
      "of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded\n",
      "in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face\n",
      "came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could\n",
      "be alone it was impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was\n",
      "one of his nights at the Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal\n",
      "in the canteen, hurried oﬀto the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a\n",
      "’discussion group’, played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses\n",
      "of gin, and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ’Ingsoc in relation to\n",
      "chess’. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to\n",
      "shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I love you the desire to\n",
      "stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed\n",
      "stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed — in\n",
      "the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept\n",
      "silent — that he was able to think continuously.\n",
      "It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with\n",
      "the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the possibility\n",
      "that she might be laying some kind of trap for him.\n",
      "He knew that it was\n",
      "not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note.\n",
      "Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor\n",
      "did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. Only ﬁve nights ago\n",
      "he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was\n",
      "of no importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it\n",
      "in his dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head\n",
      "stuﬀed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at\n",
      "the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away\n",
      "from him! What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply\n",
      "change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical\n",
      "diﬃculty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess\n",
      "when you were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced\n",
      "you. Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred\n",
      "to him within ﬁve minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think,\n",
      "he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a\n",
      "table.\n",
      "Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not\n",
      "be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have been\n",
      "comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the\n",
      "building the Fiction Departrnent lay, and he had no pretext for going there. If\n",
      "62\n",
      "\n",
      "he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have\n",
      "contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her\n",
      "home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry,\n",
      "which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it\n",
      "was out of the question. By a routine that was not even secret, all letters were\n",
      "opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the messages\n",
      "that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with\n",
      "long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any\n",
      "case he did not know the girl’s name, let alone her address. Finally he decided\n",
      "that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself,\n",
      "somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a\n",
      "suﬃcient buzz of conversation all round — if these conditions endured for, say,\n",
      "thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.\n",
      "For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she did\n",
      "not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already\n",
      "blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They passed each\n",
      "other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual\n",
      "time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. Then for\n",
      "three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed\n",
      "to be aﬄicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made\n",
      "every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak\n",
      "or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her\n",
      "image. He did not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it\n",
      "was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at\n",
      "a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There\n",
      "was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might have\n",
      "committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania:\n",
      "worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided\n",
      "to avoid him.\n",
      "The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had\n",
      "a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist.\n",
      "The relief of seeing her was so\n",
      "great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. On\n",
      "the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came\n",
      "into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was\n",
      "quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full. The queue edged\n",
      "forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes\n",
      "because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet\n",
      "of saccharine. But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and\n",
      "began to make for her table. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching\n",
      "for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from\n",
      "him. Another two seconds would do it. Then a voice behind him called, ’Smith!’\n",
      "He pretended not to hear. ’Smith!’ repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no\n",
      "use. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher,\n",
      "whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his\n",
      "table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not\n",
      "go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat\n",
      "down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had\n",
      "a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The\n",
      "girl’s table ﬁlled up a few minutes later.\n",
      "But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would\n",
      "63\n",
      "\n",
      "take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was\n",
      "at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately\n",
      "ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a\n",
      "ﬂat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter\n",
      "with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl’s table.\n",
      "His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, but\n",
      "something in the little man’s appearance suggested that he would be suﬃciently\n",
      "attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart\n",
      "Winston followed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. At this\n",
      "moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man was sprawling on all\n",
      "fours, his tray had gone ﬂying, two streams of soup and coﬀee were ﬂowing\n",
      "across the ﬂoor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston,\n",
      "whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right.\n",
      "Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl’s\n",
      "table.\n",
      "He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. It\n",
      "was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible\n",
      "fear had taken possession of him.\n",
      "A week had gone by since she had ﬁrst\n",
      "approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed\n",
      "her mind! It was impossible that this aﬀair should end successfully; such things\n",
      "did not happen in real life. He might have ﬂinched altogether from speaking if\n",
      "at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering\n",
      "limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague\n",
      "way Ampleforth was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his\n",
      "table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act.\n",
      "Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuﬀthey were eating was\n",
      "a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began\n",
      "speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuﬀ\n",
      "into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words\n",
      "in low expressionless voices.\n",
      "’What time do you leave work?’\n",
      "’Eighteen-thirty.’\n",
      "’Where can we meet?’\n",
      "’Victory Square, near the monument.\n",
      "’It’s full of telescreens.’\n",
      "’It doesn’t matter if there’s a crowd.’\n",
      "’Any signal?’\n",
      "’No. Don’t come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And\n",
      "don’t look at me. Just keep somewhere near me.’\n",
      "’What time?’\n",
      "’Nineteen hours.’\n",
      "’All right.’\n",
      "Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They did\n",
      "not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite\n",
      "sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The girl ﬁnished her\n",
      "lunch quickly and made oﬀ, while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette.\n",
      "Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered\n",
      "round the base of the enormous ﬂuted column, at the top of which Big Brother’s\n",
      "statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian\n",
      "aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle\n",
      "64\n",
      "\n",
      "of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on\n",
      "horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At ﬁve minutes\n",
      "past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon\n",
      "Winston. She was not coming, she had changed her mind! He walked slowly\n",
      "up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from\n",
      "identifying St Martin’s Church, whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed\n",
      "’You owe me three farthings.’ Then he saw the girl standing at the base of\n",
      "the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the\n",
      "column. It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated.\n",
      "There were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was\n",
      "a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left.\n",
      "Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped\n",
      "nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush.\n",
      "Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a\n",
      "convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.\n",
      "Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square.\n",
      "Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge\n",
      "of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the\n",
      "heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm’s length of the girl, but the way\n",
      "was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman,\n",
      "presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of ﬂesh. Win-\n",
      "ston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his\n",
      "shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being\n",
      "ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through,\n",
      "sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder to shoulder, both\n",
      "staring ﬁxedly in front of them.\n",
      "A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine\n",
      "guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street. In\n",
      "the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed\n",
      "close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks\n",
      "utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank-clank of\n",
      "metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load of\n",
      "the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but he saw them only\n",
      "intermittently. The girl’s shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were\n",
      "pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth.\n",
      "She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the\n",
      "canteen. She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with\n",
      "lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the\n",
      "rumbling of the trucks.\n",
      "’Can you hear me?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’Can you get Sunday afternoon oﬀ?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’Then listen carefully.\n",
      "You’ll have to remember this.\n",
      "Go to Paddington\n",
      "Station-’\n",
      "With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the route\n",
      "that he was to follow. A half-hour railway journey; turn left outside the station;\n",
      "two kilometres along the road: a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a\n",
      "ﬁeld; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead tree with moss on it.\n",
      "It was as though she had a map inside her head. ’Can you remember all that?’\n",
      "65\n",
      "\n",
      "she murmured ﬁnally.\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate’s got no top bar.’\n",
      "’Yes. What time?’\n",
      "’About ﬁfteen. You may have to wait. I’ll get there by another way. Are\n",
      "you sure you remember everything?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’Then get away from me as quick as you can.’\n",
      "She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not ex-\n",
      "tricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still ﬁling post, the people\n",
      "still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but\n",
      "it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped.\n",
      "The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eura-\n",
      "sia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw\n",
      "them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more\n",
      "than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them,\n",
      "apart from the few who were hanged as war-criminals: te others simply van-\n",
      "ished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round Mogol faces had given\n",
      "way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From\n",
      "over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston’s, sometimes with strange\n",
      "intensity, and ﬂashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the\n",
      "last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing\n",
      "upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having\n",
      "them bound together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But\n",
      "at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his\n",
      "and gave it a ﬂeeting squeeze.\n",
      "It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their\n",
      "hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail of her hand.\n",
      "He explored the long ﬁngers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with\n",
      "its row of callouses, the smooth ﬂesh under the wrist. Merely from feeling it he\n",
      "would have known it by sight. In the same instant it occurred to him that he\n",
      "did not know what colour the girl’s eyes were. They were probably brown, but\n",
      "people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at\n",
      "her would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible\n",
      "among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of\n",
      "the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston\n",
      "out of nests of hair.\n",

      "Chapter 10\n",
      "Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping\n",
      "out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left\n",
      "of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one’s skin.\n",
      "It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood\n",
      "came the droning of ring doves.\n",
      "He was a bit early. There had been no diﬃculties about the journey, and\n",
      "the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would\n",
      "normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to ﬁnd a safe place. In\n",
      "general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in\n",
      "London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger\n",
      "of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recog-\n",
      "nized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting\n",
      "attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get\n",
      "your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the\n",
      "railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found\n",
      "there and asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on\n",
      "the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that\n",
      "he was not being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because\n",
      "of the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was\n",
      "ﬁlled to overﬂowing by a single enormous family.\n",
      "ranging from a toothless\n",
      "great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with\n",
      "’in-laws’ in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold\n",
      "of a little blackmarket butter.\n",
      "The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him\n",
      "of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch,\n",
      "but it could not be ﬁfteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was\n",
      "impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began picking some partly\n",
      "to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a\n",
      "bunch of ﬂowers to oﬀer to the girl when they met. He had got together a big\n",
      "bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze\n",
      "him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells.\n",
      "It was the best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been followed\n",
      "after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A\n",
      "hand fell lightly on his shoulder.\n",
      "He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning\n",
      "that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along\n",
      "the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for\n",
      "67\n",
      "\n",
      "she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still clasping\n",
      "his bunch of ﬂowers. His ﬁrst feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong\n",
      "slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight\n",
      "enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority was\n",
      "heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round\n",
      "and looked at him she would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and\n",
      "the greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on the walk from the station\n",
      "the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors,\n",
      "with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that\n",
      "till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They\n",
      "came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced\n",
      "apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston\n",
      "followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll\n",
      "surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl stopped and\n",
      "turned.\n",
      "’Here we are,’ she said.\n",
      "He was facing her at several paces’ distance. As yet he did not dare move\n",
      "nearer to her.\n",
      "’I didn’t want to say anything in the lane,’ she went on, ’in case there’s a\n",
      "mike hidden there. I don’t suppose there is, but there could be. There’s always\n",
      "the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We’re all right here.’\n",
      "He still had not the courage to approach her. ’We’re all right here?’ he\n",
      "repeated stupidly.\n",
      "’Yes. Look at the trees.’ They were small ashes, which at some time had\n",
      "been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of them\n",
      "thicker than one’s wrist. ’There’s nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides,\n",
      "I’ve been here before.’\n",
      "They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her\n",
      "now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that looked\n",
      "faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act. The\n",
      "bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of their\n",
      "own accord. He took her hand.\n",
      "’Would you believe,’ he said, ’that till this moment I didn’t know what colour\n",
      "your eyes were?’ They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with\n",
      "dark lashes. ’Now that you’ve seen what I’m really like, can you still bear to\n",
      "look at me?’\n",
      "’Yes, easily.’\n",
      "’I’m thirty-nine years old. I’ve got a wife that I can’t get rid of. I’ve got\n",
      "varicose veins. I’ve got ﬁve false teeth.’\n",
      "’I couldn’t care less,’ said the girl.\n",
      "The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his his arms.\n",
      "At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful body\n",
      "was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and\n",
      "yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth.\n",
      "She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious\n",
      "one, loved one.\n",
      "He had pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly\n",
      "unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he had\n",
      "no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity\n",
      "and pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire.\n",
      "It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much\n",
      "68\n",
      "\n",
      "used to living without women — he did not know the reason. The girl picked\n",
      "herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting\n",
      "her arm round his waist.\n",
      "’Never mind, dear. There’s no hurry. We’ve got the whole afternoon. Isn’t\n",
      "this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a community hike.\n",
      "If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.’\n",
      "’What is your name?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Julia. I know yours. It’s Winston — Winston Smith.’\n",
      "’How did you ﬁnd that out?’\n",
      "’I expect I’m better at ﬁnding things out than you are, dear. Tell me, what\n",
      "did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?’\n",
      "He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her.\n",
      "It was even a sort of\n",
      "love-oﬀering to start oﬀby telling the worst.\n",
      "’I hated the sight of you,’ he said. ’I wanted to rape you and then murder you\n",
      "afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in with\n",
      "a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you had something\n",
      "to do with the Thought Police.’\n",
      "The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a tribute to the excel-\n",
      "lence of her disguise.\n",
      "’Not the Thought Police! You didn’t honestly think that?’\n",
      "’Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance — merely\n",
      "because you’re young and fresh and healthy, you understand — I thought that\n",
      "probably-’\n",
      "’You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners,\n",
      "processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuﬀ. And you thought\n",
      "that if I had a quarter of a chance I’d denounce you as a thought-criminal and\n",
      "get you killed oﬀ?’\n",
      "’Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that, you\n",
      "know.’\n",
      "’It’s this bloody thing that does it,’ she said, ripping oﬀthe scarlet sash of\n",
      "the Junior Anti-Sex League and ﬂinging it on to a bough. Then, as though\n",
      "touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her\n",
      "overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke it in half and gave\n",
      "one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell\n",
      "that it was very unusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in\n",
      "silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuﬀthat tasted, as\n",
      "nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish ﬁre. But at some\n",
      "time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. The\n",
      "ﬁrst whiﬀof its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down,\n",
      "but which was powerful and troubling.\n",
      "’Where did you get this stuﬀ?’ he said.\n",
      "’Black market,’ she said indiﬀerently. ’Actually I am that sort of girl, to\n",
      "look at. I’m good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary\n",
      "work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours\n",
      "I’ve spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry one end of\n",
      "a banner in the processions. I always Iook cheerful and I never shirk anything.\n",
      "Always yell with the crowd, that’s what I say. It’s the only way to be safe.’\n",
      "The ﬁrst fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston’s tongue. The taste\n",
      "was delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his\n",
      "consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to deﬁnite shape, like\n",
      "69\n",
      "\n",
      "an object seen out of the corner of one’s eye. He pushed it away from him,\n",
      "aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked\n",
      "to undo but could not.\n",
      "’You are very young,’ he said. ’You are ten or ﬁfteen years younger than I\n",
      "am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?’\n",
      "’It was something in your face. I thought I’d take a chance. I’m good at\n",
      "spotting people who don’t belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you were against\n",
      "them.’\n",
      "Them, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about\n",
      "whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy,\n",
      "although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere.\n",
      "A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.\n",
      "Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom\n",
      "did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the\n",
      "Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you\n",
      "saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It was merely\n",
      "one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it\n",
      "seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. They\n",
      "had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade,\n",
      "with their arms round each other’s waists whenever it was wide enough to walk\n",
      "two abreast. He noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the\n",
      "sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia\n",
      "said, it was better to go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the\n",
      "little wood. She stopped him.\n",
      "’Don’t go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We’re all\n",
      "right if we keep behind the boughs.’\n",
      "They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, ﬁltering\n",
      "through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked out\n",
      "into the ﬁeld beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He\n",
      "knew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across\n",
      "it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the\n",
      "boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves\n",
      "stirred faintly in dense masses like women’s hair. Surely somewhere nearby,\n",
      "but out of sight, there must be a stream with green pools where dace were\n",
      "swimming?\n",
      "’Isn’t there a stream somewhere near here?’ he whispered.\n",
      "’That’s right, there is a stream. It’s at the edge of the next ﬁeld, actually.\n",
      "There are ﬁsh in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying in the pools under\n",
      "the willow trees, waving their tails.’\n",
      "’It’s the Golden Country — almost,’ he murmured.\n",
      "’The Golden Country?’\n",
      "’It’s nothing, really. A landscape I’ve seen sometimes in a dream.’\n",
      "’Look!’ whispered Julia.\n",
      "A thrush had alighted on a bough not ﬁve metres away, almost at the level\n",
      "of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the\n",
      "shade. It spread out its wings, ﬁtted them carefully into place again, ducked\n",
      "its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and\n",
      "then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume\n",
      "of sound was startling.\n",
      "Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated.\n",
      "The\n",
      "music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never\n",
      "70\n",
      "\n",
      "once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing oﬀ\n",
      "its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled\n",
      "its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston\n",
      "watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird\n",
      "singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the\n",
      "lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after\n",
      "all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken\n",
      "only in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would\n",
      "pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small,\n",
      "beetle-like man was listening intently — listening to that. But by degrees the\n",
      "ﬂood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a\n",
      "kind of liquid stuﬀthat poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight\n",
      "that ﬁltered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl’s\n",
      "waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled her round so that\n",
      "they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his\n",
      "hands moved it was all as yielding as water. Their mouths clung together; it\n",
      "was quite diﬀerent from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they\n",
      "moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright\n",
      "and ﬂed with a clatter of wings.\n",
      "Winston put his lips against her ear. ’Now,’ he whispered.\n",
      "’Not here,’ she whispered back. ’Come back to the hide- out. It’s safer.’\n",
      "Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back\n",
      "to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and\n",
      "faced him. They were both breathing fast. but the smile had reappeared round\n",
      "the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt\n",
      "at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost\n",
      "as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes oﬀ, and when she\n",
      "ﬂung them aside it was with that same magniﬁcent gesture by which a whole\n",
      "civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body gleamed white in the sun. But\n",
      "for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled\n",
      "face with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before her and took her hands in\n",
      "his\n",
      "’Have you done this before?’\n",
      "’Of course. Hundreds of times — well scores of times anyway ’With Party\n",

      "’Yes, always with Party members.’\n",
      "’With members of the Inner Party?’\n",
      "’Not with those swine, no. But there’s plenty that would if they got half a\n",
      "chance. They’re not so holy as they make out.’\n",
      "His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been\n",
      "hundreds — thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always ﬁlled him\n",
      "with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface,\n",
      "its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he\n",
      "could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly\n",
      "he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled\n",
      "her down so that they were kneeling face to face.\n",
      "’Listen. The more men you’ve had, the more I love you. Do you understand\n",
      "that?’\n",

      "That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one\n",
      "person but the animal instinct, the simple undiﬀerentiated desire: that was\n",
      "the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the\n",
      "grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no diﬃculty. Presently\n",
      "the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of\n",
      "pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter.\n",
      "They were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled\n",
      "them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about\n",
      "half an hour.\n",
      "Winston woke ﬁrst. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully\n",
      "asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth, you could not\n",
      "call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely.\n",
      "The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occurred to him that\n",
      "he still did not know her surname or where she lived.\n",
      "The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying,\n",
      "protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel\n",
      "tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the\n",
      "overalls aside and studied her smooth white ﬂank. In the old days, he thought,\n",
      "a man looked at a girl’s body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the\n",
      "end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No\n",
      "emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their\n",

      "As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and\n",
      "business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and\n",
      "began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this\n",
      "to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she\n",
      "seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London,\n",

      "capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning\n",
      "of the Party’s sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created\n",
      "a world of its own which was outside the Party’s control and which therefore\n",
      "had to be destroyed if possible.\n",
      "What was more important was that sexual\n",
      "privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed\n",
      "into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was:\n",
      "’When you make love you’re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy\n",

      "yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year\n",
      "Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?’\n",
      "That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion be-\n",
      "tween chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, and\n",
      "the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right\n",
      "pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving\n",
      "force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned\n",
      "it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood.\n",
      "The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encour-\n",
      "aged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children,\n",
      "on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught\n",
      "to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in eﬀect an\n",
      "extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone\n",

      "others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently\n",
      "found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. It was a\n",

      "nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she realized that they were\n",

      "even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back\n",
      "by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction. But at\n",
      "this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of\n",
      "the cliﬀbeneath them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red,\n",
      "apparently growing on the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind\n",
      "before, and he called to Katharine to come and look at it.\n",
      "’Look, Katharine! Look at those ﬂowers. That clump down near the bottom.\n",
      "Do you see they’re two diﬀerent colours?’\n",
      "She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for a\n",
      "moment. She even leaned out over the cliﬀface to see where he was pointing.\n",
      "He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady\n",
      "her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they\n",
      "were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even\n",
      "a bird awake.\n",
      "In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden\n",
      "microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only\n",

      "when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law of nature\n",
      "that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herself was\n",
      "doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her,\n",
      "but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to\n",

      "In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass\n",
      "paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the\n",
      "half-darkness.\n",
      "In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided\n",
      "by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He\n",

      "to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said,\n",
      "was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone\n",

      "the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was\n",
      "paler than usual.\n",
      "’It’s all oﬀ,’ she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak. ’Tomorrow,\n",
      "I mean.’\n",
      "’What?’\n",
      "’Tomorrow afternoon. I can’t come.’\n",
      "’Why not?’\n",
      "’Oh, the usual reason. It’s started early this time.’\n",
      "For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known\n",
      "her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there had\n",
      "been little true sensuality in it. Their ﬁrst love-making had been simply an act\n",
      "of the will. But after the second time it was diﬀerent. The smell of her hair, the\n",
      "taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into\n",
      "the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity, something that he\n",
      "not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could\n",
      "not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this moment\n",
      "the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the\n",
      "tips of his ﬁngers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but aﬀection.\n",
      "It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment\n",
      "must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not\n",
      "felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him.\n",
      "He wished that they were a\n",
      "married couple of ten years’ standing. He wished that he were walking through\n",
      "the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear,\n",
      "talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. He wished\n",
      "above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without\n",
      "feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not actually at\n",
      "that moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea of renting\n",
      "Mr Charrington’s room had occurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she\n",
      "had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy.\n",
      "It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he\n",
      "80\n",
      "\n",
      "sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry\n",
      "of Love. It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one’s\n",
      "consciousness. There it lay, ﬁxed in future times, preceding death as surely as\n",
      "99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it:\n",
      "and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to\n",
      "shorten the interval before it happened.\n",
      "At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had\n",
      "sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to\n",
      "take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly because\n",
      "she was still holding the tool-bag.\n",
      "’Half a second,’ she said. ’Just let me show you what I’ve brought. Did you\n",
      "bring some of that ﬁlthy Victory Coﬀee? I thought you would. You can chuck\n",
      "it away again, because we shan’t be needing it. Look here.’\n",
      "She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners\n",
      "and a screwdriver that ﬁlled the top part of it. Underneath were a number of\n",
      "neat paper packets. The ﬁrst packet that she passed to Winston had a strange\n",
      "and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was ﬁlled with some kind of heavy, sand-like\n",
      "stuﬀwhich yielded wherever you touched it.\n",
      "’It isn’t sugar?’ he said.\n",
      "’Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here’s a loaf of bread proper white\n",
      "bread, not our bloody stuﬀ— and a little pot of jam. And here’s a tin of milk\n",
      "— but look! This is the one I’m really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking\n",
      "round it, because-’\n",
      "But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was\n",
      "already ﬁlling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from\n",
      "his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even now, blowing\n",
      "down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diﬀusing itself mysteriously in\n",
      "a crowded street, sniﬀed for an instant and then lost again.\n",
      "’It’s coﬀee,’ he murmured, ’real coﬀee.’\n",
      "’It’s Inner Party coﬀee. There’s a whole kilo here, she said.\n",
      "’How did you manage to get hold of all these things?’\n",
      "’It’s all Inner Party stuﬀ. There’s nothing those swine don’t have, nothing.\n",
      "But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things, and — look, I got\n",
      "a little packet of tea as well.’\n",
      "Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.\n",
      "’It’s real tea. Not blackberry leaves.’\n",
      "’There’s been a lot of tea about lately. They’ve captured India, or some-\n",
      "thing,’ she said vaguely. ’But listen, dear. I want you to turn your back on me\n",
      "for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed. Don’t go too near\n",
      "the window. And don’t turn round till I tell you.’\n",
      "Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard\n",
      "the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and\n",
      "the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:\n",
      "They sye that time ’eals all things,\n",
      "They sye you can always forget;\n",
      "But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years\n",
      "They twist my ’eart-strings yet!\n",
      "She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice ﬂoated\n",
      "upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of happy\n",
      "81\n",
      "\n",
      "melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if\n",
      "the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible, to\n",
      "remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing rubbish. It\n",
      "struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party\n",
      "singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly unortho-\n",
      "dox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only when\n",
      "people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing\n",
      "about.\n",
      "’You can turn round now,’ said Julia.\n",
      "He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What\n",
      "he had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The\n",
      "transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She\n",
      "had painted her face.\n",
      "She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought\n",
      "herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her\n",
      "cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under\n",
      "the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but Winston’s\n",
      "standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined\n",
      "a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her\n",
      "appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the right places\n",
      "she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine.\n",
      "Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the eﬀect. As he took her\n",
      "in his arms a wave of synthetic violets ﬂooded his nostrils. He remembered the\n",
      "half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and a woman’s cavernous mouth. It was\n",
      "the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to\n",
      "matter.\n",
      "’Scent too!’ he said.\n",
      "’Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I’m going to do next? I’m\n",
      "going to get hold of a real woman’s frock from somewhere and wear it instead\n",
      "of these bloody trousers. I’ll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this\n",
      "room I’m going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.’\n",
      "They ﬂung their clothes oﬀand climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It\n",
      "was the ﬁrst time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence. Until now\n",
      "he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with the varicose\n",
      "veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle. There\n",
      "were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth, and\n",
      "the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them. ’It’s sure to be full\n",
      "of bugs, but who cares?’ said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays,\n",
      "except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one in his\n",
      "boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.\n",
      "Presently they fell asleep for a little while.\n",
      "When Winston woke up the\n",
      "hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because\n",
      "Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up\n",
      "had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still\n",
      "brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell\n",
      "across the foot of the bed and lighted up the ﬁreplace, where the water in the\n",
      "pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the\n",
      "faint shouts of children ﬂoated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether\n",
      "in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in\n",
      "the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making\n",
      "82\n",
      "\n",
      "love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion\n",
      "to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely\n",
      "there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up,\n",
      "rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.\n",
      "’Half that water’s boiled away,’ she said. ’I’ll get up and make some coﬀee\n",
      "in another moment. We’ve got an hour. What time do they cut the lights oﬀ\n",
      "at your ﬂats?’\n",
      "’Twenty-three thirty.’\n",
      "’It’s twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that,\n",
      "because — Hi! Get out, you ﬁlthy brute!’\n",
      "She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the ﬂoor,\n",
      "and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as\n",
      "he had seen her ﬂing the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two\n",
      "Minutes Hate.\n",
      "’What was it?’ he said in surprise.\n",
      "’A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There’s a\n",
      "hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway.’\n",
      "’Rats!’ murmured Winston. ’In this room!’\n",
      "’They’re all over the place,’ said Julia indiﬀerently as she lay down again.\n",
      "’We’ve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of London are\n",
      "swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes, they do. In\n",
      "some of these streets a woman daren’t leave a baby alone for two minutes. It’s\n",
      "the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty thing is that the brutes\n",
      "always-’\n",
      "’Don’t go on!’ said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.\n",
      "’Dearest! You’ve gone quite pale. What’s the matter? Do they make you\n",
      "feel sick?’\n",
      "’Of all horrors in the world — a rat!’\n",
      "She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though\n",
      "to reassure him with the warmth of her body.\n",
      "He did not reopen his eyes\n",
      "immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a\n",
      "nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was\n",
      "always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and\n",
      "on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful\n",
      "to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception,\n",
      "because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a\n",
      "deadly eﬀort, like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have\n",
      "dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up without discovering what\n",
      "it was: but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when\n",
      "he cut her short.\n",
      "’I’m sorry,’ he said, ’it’s nothing. I don’t like rats, that’s all.’\n",
      "’Don’t worry, dear, we’re not going to have the ﬁlthy brutes in here. I’ll stuﬀ\n",
      "the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we come here I’ll\n",
      "bring some plaster and bung it up properly.’\n",
      "Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly ashamed\n",
      "of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her\n",
      "overalls, and made the coﬀee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so\n",
      "powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should\n",
      "notice it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the\n",
      "coﬀee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost\n",
      "83\n",
      "\n",
      "forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of\n",
      "bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indiﬀer-\n",
      "ently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table,\n",
      "plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and\n",
      "examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She\n",
      "brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better\n",
      "light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery\n",
      "appearance of the glass.\n",
      "’What is it, do you think?’ said Julia.\n",
      "’I don’t think it’s anything-I mean, I don’t think it was ever put to any use.\n",
      "That’s what I like about it. It’s a little chunk of history that they’ve forgotten\n",
      "to alter. It’s a message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.’\n",
      "’And that picture over there’ — she nodded at the engraving on the opposite\n",
      "wall-’would that be a hundred years old?’\n",
      "’More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can’t tell. It’s impossible to discover\n",
      "the age of anything nowadays.’\n",
      "She went over to look at it. ’Here’s where that brute stuck his nose out,’\n",
      "she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. ’What is this\n",
      "place? I’ve seen it before somewhere.’\n",
      "’It’s a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.’\n",
      "The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into\n",
      "his head, and he added half-nostalgically: ”Oranges and lemons, say the bells\n",
      "of St Clement’s!”\n",
      "To his astonishment she capped the line:\n",
      "’You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s,\n",
      "When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey — ’\n",
      "’I can’t remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends\n",
      "up, ”Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop oﬀ\n",
      "your head!”\n",
      "It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be another line\n",
      "after ’the bells of Old Bailey’. Perhaps it could be dug out of Mr Charrington’s\n",
      "memory, if he were suitably prompted.\n",
      "’Who taught you that?’ he said.\n",
      "’My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was\n",
      "vaporized when I was eight — at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a\n",
      "lemon was,’ she added inconsequently. ’I’ve seen oranges. They’re a kind of\n",
      "round yellow fruit with a thick skin.’\n",
      "’I can remember lemons,’ said Winston. ’They were quite common in the\n",
      "ﬁfties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them.’\n",
      "’I bet that picture’s got bugs behind it,’ said Julia. ’I’ll take it down and\n",
      "give it a good clean some day. I suppose it’s almost time we were leaving. I\n",
      "must start washing this paint oﬀ. What a bore! I’ll get the lipstick oﬀyour face\n",
      "afterwards.’\n",
      "Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening.\n",
      "He turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight. The\n",
      "inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior\n",
      "of the glass itself.\n",
      "There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as\n",
      "transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch\n",
      "of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the\n",

      "84\n",
      "\n",
      "the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving\n",
      "and the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the\n",

      "In the room over Mr Charrington’s shop, when they could get there, Julia\n",
      "and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for\n",
      "the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied\n",
      "hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was\n",
      "paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper\n",
      "bought on the black market, tear oﬀtheir clothes, and make love with sweating\n",

      "Four, ﬁve, six — seven times they met during the month of June. Winston\n",
      "had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the\n",
      "need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a\n",
      "brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his ﬁts of coughing in the early morning\n",
      "had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer\n",
      "any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his\n",
      "voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even\n",
      "seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours\n",
      "at a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist.\n",
      "To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The\n",
      "room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr\n",
      "Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped\n",
      "to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old\n",
      "man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to\n",
      "have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark\n",
      "shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which\n",
      "87\n",
      "\n",
      "contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an\n",
      "enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about\n",
      "among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed\n",
      "shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a collector\n",
      "rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would ﬁnger this\n",
      "scrap of rubbish or that — a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken\n",
      "snuﬀbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby’s hair\n",
      "— never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To\n",
      "talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had\n",
      "dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten\n",
      "rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a\n",
      "cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin. ’It\n",
      "just occurred to me you might be interested,’ he would say with a deprecating\n",
      "little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. But he could never recall\n",
      "more than a few lines of any one rhyme.\n",
      "Both of them knew-in a way, it was never out of their minds that what\n",
      "was now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact of\n",
      "impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would\n",
      "cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping\n",
      "at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within ﬁve minutes of striking.\n",
      "But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but\n",
      "of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no\n",
      "harm could come to them. Getting there was diﬃcult and dangerous, but the\n",
      "room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart\n",
      "of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that\n",
      "glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave\n",
      "themselves up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would hold indeﬁnitely, and\n",
      "they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their\n",
      "natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston\n",
      "and Julia would succeed in getting married.\n",
      "Or they would commit suicide\n",
      "together. Or they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn\n",
      "to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives\n",
      "undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality\n",
      "there was no escape.\n",
      "Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they\n",
      "had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week\n",
      "to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable\n",
      "instinct, just as one’s lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is\n",
      "air available.\n",
      "Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party,\n",
      "but with no notion of how to take the ﬁrst step. Even if the fabulous Brother-\n",
      "hood was a reality, there still remained the diﬃculty of ﬁnding one’s way into\n",
      "it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between\n",
      "himself and O’Brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into\n",
      "O’Brien’s presence, announce that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand\n",
      "his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing\n",
      "to do. She was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to\n",
      "her that Winston should believe O’Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a\n",
      "single ﬂash of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly\n",
      "everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it\n",
      "safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition\n",
      "88\n",
      "\n",
      "existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army,\n",
      "she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own\n",
      "purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyond number,\n",
      "at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of\n",
      "her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in\n",
      "whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public trials were\n",
      "happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League\n",
      "who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals ’Death\n",
      "to the traitors!’ During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in\n",
      "shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Gold-\n",
      "stein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up\n",
      "since the Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of\n",
      "the ﬁfties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was\n",
      "outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It would\n",
      "always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel against it\n",
      "by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing\n",
      "somebody or blowing something up.\n",
      "In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible\n",
      "to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention\n",
      "the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion\n",
      "the war was not happening.\n",
      "The rocket bombs which fell daily on London\n",
      "were probably ﬁred by the Government of Oceania itself, ’just to keep people\n",
      "frightened’. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. She\n",
      "also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes\n",
      "Hate her great diﬃculty was to avoid bursting out laughing.\n",
      "But she only\n",
      "questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her\n",
      "own life. Often she was ready to accept the oﬃcial mythology, simply because\n",
      "the diﬀerence between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. She\n",
      "believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the Party had invented\n",
      "aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late ﬁfties,\n",
      "it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen\n",
      "years later, when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane;\n",
      "one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when\n",
      "he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long\n",
      "before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After all,\n",
      "what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock\n",
      "to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember\n",
      "that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with\n",
      "Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently\n",
      "she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. ’I thought\n",
      "we’d always been at war with Eurasia,’ she said vaguely. It frightened him a\n",
      "little. The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the\n",
      "switchover in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was\n",
      "grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In\n",
      "the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that\n",
      "at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still\n",
      "struck her as unimportant. ’Who cares?’ she said impatiently. ’It’s always one\n",
      "bloody war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway.\n",
      "Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent\n",
      "forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify her.\n",
      "89\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies be-\n",
      "coming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and\n",
      "the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his ﬁngers. It did\n",
      "not make much impression on her. At ﬁrst, indeed, she failed to grasp the point\n",
      "of the story.\n",
      "’Were they friends of yours?’ she said.\n",

      "just a question of somebody being killed. Do you realize that the past, starting\n",
      "from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it’s in a\n",
      "few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there.\n",
      "Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years\n",
      "before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsiﬁed, every book\n",
      "has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street\n",
      "and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process\n",
      "is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing\n",
      "exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of\n",
      "course, that the past is falsiﬁed, but it would never be possible for me to prove\n",
      "it, even when I did the falsiﬁcation myself. After the thing is done, no evidence\n",
      "ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don’t know with\n",
      "any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in that\n",

      "same thing happened today, I should keep it.’\n",
      "’Well, I wouldn’t!’ said Julia. ’I’m quite ready to take risks, but only for\n",
      "something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could you have\n",
      "done with it even if you had kept it?’\n",

      "imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine\n",
      "little knots of resistance springing up here and there — small groups of people\n",

      "It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, it seemed\n",

      "He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost\n",

      "aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him.\n",
      "The\n",
      "person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking.\n",
      "Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O’Brien.\n",
      "At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was\n",
      "to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of\n",
      "speaking.\n",
      "O’Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement,\n",
      "laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston’s arm, so that the two of them\n",
      "were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy\n",
      "that diﬀerentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.\n",
      "’I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,’ he said. ’I was\n",
      "reading one of your Newspeak articles in The Times the other day. You take a\n",
      "scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?’\n",
      "Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. ’Hardly scholarly,’ he said.\n",
      "’I’m only an amateur. It’s not my subject. I have never had anything to do\n",
      "with the actual construction of the language.’\n",
      "’But you write it very elegantly,’ said O’Brien. ’That is not only my own\n",
      "opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert.\n",
      "His name has slipped my memory for the moment.’\n",
      "Again Winston’s heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this was\n",
      "anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead, he\n",
      "was abolished, an unperson. Any identiﬁable reference to him would have been\n",
      "mortally dangerous. O’Brien’s remark must obviously have been intended as a\n",
      "signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the\n",
      "two of them into accomplices. They had continued to stroll slowly down the\n",
      "corridor, but now O’Brien halted. With the curious, disarming friendliness that\n",
      "he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his\n",
      "nose. Then he went on:\n",
      "’What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you\n",
      "had used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only become\n",
      "so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?’\n",
      "’No,’ said Winston. ’I didn’t think it had been issued yet. We are still using\n",

      "few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It might interest\n",
      "you to look at it, perhaps?’\n",
      "’Very much so,’ said Winston, immediately seeing where this tended.\n",
      "’Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the\n",
      "number of verbs — that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Let me\n",
      "see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I\n",
      "invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at my ﬂat\n",
      "at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you my address.’\n",
      "They were standing in front of a telescreen.\n",
      "Somewhat absentmindedly\n",
      "O’Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered note-\n",
      "book and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a po-\n",
      "sition that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could\n",
      "read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page and handed\n",
      "it to Winston.\n",
      "’I am usually at home in the evenings,’ he said. ’If not, my servant will give\n",
      "you the dictionary.’\n",
      "He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time\n",
      "there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was\n",
      "written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with\n",
      "a mass of other papers.\n",
      "They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.\n",
      "There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have.\n",
      "It had\n",
      "been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O’Brien’s address. This was\n",
      "necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover\n",
      "where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. ’If you ever want to\n",
      "see me, this is where I can be found,’ was what O’Brien had been saying to him.\n",
      "Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary.\n",
      "But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of\n",
      "did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of it.\n",
      "He knew that sooner or later he would obey O’Brien’s summons. Perhaps\n",
      "tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay — he was not certain. What was happen-\n",
      "ing was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The ﬁrst\n",
      "step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening\n",
      "of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to\n",
      "actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of\n",
      "Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was\n",
      "frightening: or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little\n",
      "less alive. Even while he was speaking to O’Brien, when the meaning of the\n",
      "words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body.\n",
      "He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not\n",

      "for him.\n",

      "’I dreamt-’ he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put into\n",
      "words. There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected with it\n",
      "that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.\n",
      "He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream.\n",
      "It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out\n",
      "before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred\n",
      "inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky,\n",
      "and inside the dome everything was ﬂooded with clear soft light in which one\n",
      "could see into interminable distances. The dream had also been comprehended\n",
      "by — indeed, in some sense it had consisted in — a gesture of the arm made\n",
      "by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had\n",
      "seen on the news ﬁlm, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before\n",

      "In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within\n",
      "a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all\n",
      "come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his\n",
      "consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but he could\n",
      "not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened.\n",
      "His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could\n",
      "not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of the\n",
      "time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations,\n",
      "the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations posted at street\n",
      "corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues\n",

      "’No!’ broke in Julia.\n",
      "It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For\n",
      "a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. His\n",
      "tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables ﬁrst of one word, then\n",
      "of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not know which\n",
      "word he was going to say. ’No,’ he said ﬁnally.\n",
      "’You did well to tell me,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "’It is necessary for us to know\n",
      "everything.’\n",
      "He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more\n",
      "expression in it:\n",
      "’Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a diﬀerent person?\n",
      "We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his movements, the\n",
      "shape of his hands, the colour of his hair — even his voice would be diﬀerent.\n",
      "And you yourself might have become a diﬀerent person.\n",
      "Our surgeons can\n",
      "alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is necessary. Sometimes we even\n",
      "amputate a limb.’\n",
      "Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin’s Mon-\n",
      "golian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a shade\n",
      "paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O’Brien boldly.\n",
      "She\n",
      "murmured something that seemed to be assent.\n",
      "’Good. Then that is settled.’\n",
      "There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather absent-\n",
      "minded air O’Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself, then\n",
      "stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think better\n",
      "standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed, with an\n",
      "unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O’Brien looked at his wrist-watch again.\n",
      "’You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,’ he said. ’I shall switch on\n",
      "in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades’ faces before you\n",
      "go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.\n",
      "Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man’s dark eyes ﬂickered\n",
      "over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. He was\n",
      "memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to\n",
      "feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable\n",
      "of changing its expression. Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation,\n",
      "Martin went out, closing the door silently behind him. O’Brien was strolling up\n",
      "and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his\n",
      "cigarette.\n",
      "102\n",
      "\n",
      "’You understand,’ he said, ’that you will be ﬁghting in the dark. You will\n",
      "always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them, without\n",
      "knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true\n",
      "nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it.\n",
      "When you have read the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood.\n",
      "But between the general aims that we are ﬁghting for and the immediate tasks\n",
      "of the moment, you will never know anything. I tell you that the Brotherhood\n",
      "exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members, or ten\n",
      "million. From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it\n",
      "numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have three or four contacts, who\n",
      "will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. As this was your ﬁrst\n",
      "contact, it will be preserved. When you receive orders, they will come from\n",
      "me. If we ﬁnd it necessary to communicate with you, it will be through Martin.\n",
      "When you are ﬁnally caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you\n",
      "will have very little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be\n",
      "able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will\n",
      "not even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a\n",
      "diﬀerent person, with a diﬀerent face.’\n",
      "He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the bulkiness\n",
      "of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It came out even\n",
      "in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a\n",
      "cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression of conﬁdence and\n",
      "of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he might be, he\n",
      "had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke\n",
      "of murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was\n",
      "with a faint air of persiﬂage. ’This is unavoidable,’ his voice seemed to say;\n",
      "’this is what we have got to do, unﬂinchingly. But this is not what we shall be\n",
      "doing when life is worth living again.’ A wave of admiration, almost of worship,\n",
      "ﬂowed out from Winston towards O’Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the\n",
      "shadowy ﬁgure of Goldstein. When you looked at O’Brien’s powerful shoulders\n",
      "and his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to\n",
      "believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was not equal\n",
      "to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to be impressed.\n",
      "She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently. O’Brien went on:\n",
      "’You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt\n",
      "you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a huge\n",
      "underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on\n",
      "walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the\n",
      "hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no\n",
      "way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to\n",
      "be aware of the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he\n",
      "fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list\n",
      "of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. No\n",
      "such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an\n",
      "organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea\n",
      "which is indestructible. You will never have anything to sustain you, except the\n",
      "idea. You will get no comradeship and no encouragement. When ﬁnally you\n",
      "are caught, you will get no help. We never help our members. At most, when\n",
      "it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally\n",
      "able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner’s cell. You will have to get used\n",
      "103\n",
      "\n",
      "to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while, you will\n",
      "be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results\n",
      "that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible change will\n",
      "happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the\n",
      "future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But\n",
      "how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand\n",
      "years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by\n",
      "little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards\n",
      "from individual to individual, generation after generation. In the face of the\n",
      "Thought Police there is no other way.’\n",
      "He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.\n",
      "’It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,’ he said to Julia. ’Wait. The\n",
      "decanter is still half full.’\n",
      "He ﬁlled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.\n",
      "’What shall it be this time?’ he said, still with the same faint suggestion of\n",
      "irony. ’To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the death of Big Brother?\n",
      "To humanity? To the future?’\n",
      "’To the past,’ said Winston.\n",
      "’The past is more important,’ agreed O’Brien gravely.\n",
      "They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go. O’Brien\n",
      "took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a ﬂat white tablet\n",
      "which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important, he said, not to go\n",
      "out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant. As soon as the\n",
      "door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. He took another\n",
      "pace or two up and down, then stopped.\n",
      "’There are details to be settled,’ he said. ’I assume that you have a hiding-\n",
      "place of some kind?’\n",
      "Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington’s shop.\n",
      "’That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you.\n",
      "It is important to change one’s hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send\n",
      "you a copy of the book’ — even O’Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce\n",
      "the words as though they were in italics- ’Goldstein’s book, you understand, as\n",
      "soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold of one. There\n",
      "are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunt them\n",
      "down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them. It makes very\n",
      "little diﬀerence. The book is indestructible. If the last copy were gone, we could\n",
      "reproduce it almost word for word. Do you carry a brief-case to work with you?’\n",
      "he added.\n",
      "’As a rule, yes.’\n",
      "’What is it like?’\n",
      "’Black, very shabby. With two straps.’\n",
      "’Black, two straps, very shabby — good. One day in the fairly near future-\n",
      "I cannot give a date — one of the messages among your morning’s work will\n",
      "contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a repeat.\n",
      "On the\n",
      "following day you will go to work without your brief-case. At some time during\n",
      "the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the arm and say ”I think you have\n",
      "dropped your brief-case.” The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein’s\n",
      "book. You will return it within fourteen days.’\n",
      "They were silent for a moment.\n",
      "104\n",
      "\n",
      "’There are a couple of minutes before you need go,’ said O’Brien. ’We shall\n",
      "meet again — if we do meet again-’\n",
      "Winston looked up at him. ’In the place where there is no darkness?’ he\n",
      "said hesitantly.\n",
      "O’Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. ’In the place where there\n",
      "is no darkness,’ he said, as though he had recognized the allusion.\n",
      "’And in\n",
      "the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? Any\n",
      "message? Any question?.’\n",
      "Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he\n",
      "wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding general-\n",
      "ities. Instead of anything directly connected with O’Brien or the Brotherhood,\n",
      "there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where\n",
      "his mother had spent her last days, and the little room over Mr Charrington’s\n",
      "shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame.\n",
      "Almost at random he said:\n",
      "’Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins ”Oranges and lemons,\n",
      "say the bells of St Clement’s”?’\n",
      "Again O’Brien nodded.\n",
      "With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the\n",
      "stanza:\n",
      "’Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s,\n",
      "You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s,\n",
      "When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey\n",
      "When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.’\n",
      "’You knew the last line!’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go.\n",
      "But wait. You had better let me give you one of these tablets.’\n",
      "As Winston stood up O’Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushed\n",
      "the bones of Winston’s palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O’Brien\n",
      "seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting\n",
      "with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him Winston\n",
      "could see the writing-table with its green- shaded lamp and the speakwrite and\n",
      "the wire baskets deep-laden with papers.\n",
      "The incident was closed.\n",
      "Within\n",
      "thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O’Brien would be back at his interrupted\n",

      "\n",

      "Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It had\n",
      "come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the weak-\n",
      "ness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his hand he would\n",
      "be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been drained\n",
      "out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of\n",
      "nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magniﬁed. His overalls\n",
      "fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing\n",
      "of a hand was an eﬀort that made his joints creak.\n",
      "He had worked more than ninety hours in ﬁve days. So had everyone else in\n",
      "the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no Party\n",
      "work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in\n",
      "the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in mild afternoon\n",
      "sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington’s\n",
      "shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this\n",
      "afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him. The heavy brief-\n",
      "case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step, sending a\n",
      "tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg.\n",
      "Inside it was the book,\n",
      "which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened,\n",
      "nor even looked at.\n",
      "On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the\n",
      "shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the ﬁlms, the waxworks, the\n",
      "rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the\n",
      "grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming\n",
      "of guns — after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its\n",
      "climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that\n",
      "if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals\n",
      "who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would\n",
      "unquestionably have torn them to pieces — at just this moment it had been\n",
      "announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at\n",
      "war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.\n",
      "There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely\n",
      "it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that Easta-\n",
      "sia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration\n",
      "in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened. It was\n",
      "night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly ﬂoodlit. The\n",
      "square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a\n",
      "thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped plat-\n",

      "long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was\n",
      "haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin ﬁgure, contorted with hatred,\n",
      "he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous\n",
      "at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice,\n",
      "made metallic by the ampliﬁers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atroci-\n",
      "ties, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of\n",
      "civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost\n",
      "impossible to listen to him without being ﬁrst convinced and then maddened.\n",
      "At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the\n",
      "speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from\n",
      "thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren.\n",
      "The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger\n",
      "hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker’s\n",
      "hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered\n",
      "in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly\n",
      "the names were diﬀerent. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled\n",
      "through the crowd. Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there\n",
      "was a tremendous commotion. The banners and posters with which the square\n",
      "was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them.\n",
      "It was sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous\n",
      "interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and\n",
      "trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering\n",
      "over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that ﬂuttered from the chimneys.\n",
      "But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the\n",
      "neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at\n",
      "the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral\n",
      "roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly\n",
      "as before, except that the target had been changed.\n",
      "The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had\n",
      "switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a\n",
      "pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other\n",
      "things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder while the posters\n",
      "were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him\n",
      "on the shoulder and said, ’Excuse me, I think you’ve dropped your brief-case.’\n",
      "He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking. He knew that it would\n",
      "be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. The instant that the\n",
      "demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the\n",
      "time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staﬀof the Ministry had\n",
      "done likewise. The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to\n",
      "their posts, were hardly necessary.\n",
      "Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with\n",
      "Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of ﬁve years was now com-\n",
      "pletely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pam-\n",
      "phlets, ﬁlms, sound-tracks, photographs — all had to be rectiﬁed at lightning\n",
      "speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the\n",
      "Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eura-\n",
      "sia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence anywhere. The\n",
      "work was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it involved\n",
      "could not be called by their true names. Everyone in the Records Department\n",
      "107\n",
      "\n",
      "worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep.\n",
      "Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors:\n",
      "meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coﬀee wheeled round on trolleys by\n",
      "attendants from the canteen. Each time that Winston broke oﬀfor one of his\n",
      "spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he\n",

      "overﬂowing on to the ﬂoor, so that the ﬁrst job was always to stack them into\n",
      "a neat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst of all was that\n",
      "the work was by no means purely mechanical. Often it was enough merely to\n",
      "substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded\n",
      "care and imagination.\n",
      "Even the geographical knowledge that one needed in\n",

      "It was like struggling with some crushing physical task,\n",

      "neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember it, he\n",
      "was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite,\n",

      "The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event\n",
      "which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth\n",
      "century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by\n",
      "the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were\n",
      "already eﬀectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct\n",
      "unit after another decade of confused ﬁghting. The frontiers between the three\n",
      "super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they ﬂuctuate according\n",
      "to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia\n",
      "comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-\n",
      "mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the\n",
      "Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion\n",
      "of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less deﬁnite western\n",
      "frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese\n",
      "islands and a large but ﬂuctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.\n",
      "In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently\n",
      "at war, and have been so for the past twenty-ﬁve years.\n",
      "War, however, is\n",
      "no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades\n",
      "of the twentieth centary. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants\n",
      "who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for ﬁghting and\n",
      "are not divided by any genuine ideological diﬀerence. This is not to say that\n",
      "either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less\n",
      "bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous\n",
      "and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter\n",
      "of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against\n",
      "prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as\n",
      "normal, and, when they are committed by one’s own side and not by the enemy,\n",
      "meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people,\n",
      "mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties. The\n",
      "ﬁghting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts\n",
      "the average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses which\n",

      "crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact\n",
      "changed its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have\n",
      "changed in their order of importance. Motives which were already present to\n",
      "some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth centuary have now\n",
      "become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.\n",
      "To understand the nature of the present war — for in spite of the regrouping\n",
      "which occurs every few years, it is always the same war — one must realize in\n",
      "the ﬁrst place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-\n",
      "states could be deﬁnitively conquered even by the other two in combination.\n",
      "They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable.\n",

      "habitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to ﬁght\n",
      "about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production\n",
      "and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was\n",
      "a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw\n",
      "materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three\n",
      "super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs\n",
      "within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose,\n",
      "it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not\n",
      "permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral\n",
      "with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing\n",
      "within it about a ﬁfth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession\n",
      "of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three\n",
      "powers are constantly struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the\n",
      "whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and\n",
      "it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery\n",
      "that dictates the endless changes of alignment.\n",
      "All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them\n",
      "yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it\n",
      "is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above all\n",
      "they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls\n",

      "heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate. Moreover, the labour of\n",
      "the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world’s\n",
      "economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they\n",
      "110\n",
      "\n",
      "produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always\n",
      "to be in a better position in which to wage another war. By their labour the\n",
      "slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But\n",
      "if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it\n",
      "maintains itself, would not be essentially diﬀerent.\n",
      "The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of\n",
      "doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the\n",
      "directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine\n",
      "without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nine-\n",
      "teenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods\n",
      "has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even\n",
      "have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have\n",
      "become so, even if no artiﬁcial processes of destruction had been at work. The\n",
      "world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that\n",
      "existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to\n",
      "which the people of that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century,\n",
      "the vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and eﬃcient\n",
      "— a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete —\n",
      "was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and tech-\n",
      "nology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume\n",
      "that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the\n",
      "impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because\n",
      "scientiﬁc and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought,\n",
      "which could not survive in a strictly regimented society. As a whole the world\n",
      "is more primitive today than it was ﬁfty years ago. Certain backward areas\n",
      "have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare\n",
      "and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have\n",
      "largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-ﬁfties have\n",
      "never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are\n",
      "still there. From the moment when the machine ﬁrst made its appearance it was\n",
      "clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to\n",
      "a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used\n",
      "deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be\n",
      "eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any\n",
      "such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which\n",
      "it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living\n",
      "standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about ﬁfty\n",
      "years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.\n",
      "But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the\n",
      "destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical\n",
      "society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat,\n",
      "lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car\n",
      "or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form\n",
      "of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth\n",
      "would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society\n",
      "in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be\n",
      "evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged\n",
      "caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure\n",
      "and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who\n",
      "are normally stupeﬁed by poverty would become literate and would learn to\n",
      "111\n",
      "\n",
      "think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner\n",
      "or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would\n",
      "sweep it away.\n",
      "In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on\n",
      "a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as some\n",
      "thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not\n",
      "a practicable solution. It conﬂicted with the tendency towards mechanization\n",
      "which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and\n",
      "moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in\n",
      "a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its\n",
      "more advanced rivals.\n",
      "Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting\n",
      "the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the ﬁnal phase\n",
      "of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries\n",
      "was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was\n",
      "not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and\n",
      "kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and\n",
      "since the privations it inﬂicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition\n",
      "inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without\n",
      "increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they\n",
      "must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by\n",
      "continuous warfare.\n",
      "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of\n",
      "the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring\n",
      "into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might\n",
      "otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long\n",
      "run, too intelligent.\n",
      "Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed,\n",
      "their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without\n",
      "producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example,\n",
      "has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships.\n",
      "Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material beneﬁt\n",
      "to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is\n",
      "built. In principle the war eﬀort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus\n",
      "that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the\n",
      "needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there\n",
      "is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an\n",
      "advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere\n",
      "near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the\n",
      "importance of small privileges and thus magniﬁes the distinction between one\n",
      "group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a\n",
      "member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless,\n",
      "the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed ﬂat, the better\n",
      "texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his\n",
      "two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter — set him in a diﬀerent\n",
      "world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party\n",
      "have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we\n",
      "call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the\n",
      "possession of a lump of horseﬂesh makes the diﬀerence between wealth and\n",
      "poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore\n",
      "in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural,\n",
      "unavoidable condition of survival.\n",
      "112\n",
      "\n",
      "War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accom-\n",
      "plishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite\n",
      "simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyra-\n",
      "mids, by digging holes and ﬁlling them up again, or even by producing vast\n",
      "quantities of goods and then setting ﬁre to them. But this would provide only\n",
      "the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is\n",
      "concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so\n",
      "long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even\n",
      "the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even\n",
      "intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a\n",
      "credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adula-\n",
      "tion, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have\n",
      "the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the\n",
      "war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not\n",
      "matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state\n",
      "of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires\n",
      "of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is\n",
      "now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it\n",
      "becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the\n",
      "enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary\n",
      "for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is\n",
      "untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is ei-\n",
      "ther not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared\n",
      "ones: but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink.\n",
      "Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief\n",
      "that the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania the\n",
      "undisputed master of the entire world.\n",
      "All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article\n",
      "of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more ter-\n",
      "ritory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the\n",
      "discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons\n",
      "continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which\n",
      "the inventive or speculative type of mind can ﬁnd any outlet. In Oceania at the\n",
      "present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak\n",
      "there is no word for ’Science’. The empirical method of thought, on which all\n",
      "the scientiﬁc achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most\n",
      "fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological progress only hap-\n",
      "pens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human\n",
      "liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going back-\n",
      "wards. The ﬁelds are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by\n",
      "machinery. But in matters of vital importance — meaning, in eﬀect, war and\n",
      "police espionage — the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least toler-\n",
      "ated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth\n",
      "and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There\n",
      "are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is\n",
      "how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and\n",
      "the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without\n",
      "giving warning beforehand. In so far as scientiﬁc research still continues, this\n",
      "is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist\n",

      "for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically\n",
      "part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push\n",
      "its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the\n",
      "principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If\n",
      "Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and\n",
      "Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of\n",
      "great physical diﬃculty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million\n",
      "people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic\n",
      "level. The problem is the same for all three super-states. It is absolutely neces-\n",
      "sary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except,\n",
      "to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the oﬃcial\n",
      "ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners\n",
      "apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eura-\n",
      "sia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he\n",
      "were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures\n",
      "similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.\n",
      "The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and\n",
      "self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore\n",
      "realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon\n",
      "may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except\n",
      "bombs.\n",
      "Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and\n",
      "acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very\n",
      "much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia\n",
      "it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usu-\n",

      "of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets\n",
      "of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous\n",
      "outrages upon morality and common sense.\n",
      "Actually the three philosophies\n",
      "are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not\n",
      "distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the\n",
      "same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for con-\n",
      "tinuous warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer\n",
      "one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so\n",
      "long as they remain in conﬂict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of\n",
      "corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously\n",
      "aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world\n",
      "conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue\n",
      "everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the fact that there is no danger\n",
      "of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of\n",
      "Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has\n",
      "been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed\n",
      "its character.\n",
      "In past ages, a war, almost by deﬁnition, was something that sooner or later\n",
      "115\n",
      "\n",
      "came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the past, also,\n",
      "war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in\n",
      "touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false\n",
      "view of the world upon their followers, but they could not aﬀord to encourage\n",
      "any illusion that tended to impair military eﬃciency. So long as defeat meant\n",
      "the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable,\n",
      "the precautions against defeat had to be serious. Physical facts could not be\n",
      "ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might\n",
      "make ﬁve, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make\n",
      "four. Ineﬃcient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle\n",
      "for eﬃciency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be eﬃcient it was necessary\n",
      "to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of\n",
      "what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course,\n",
      "always coloured and biased, but falsiﬁcation of the kind that is practised today\n",
      "would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far\n",
      "as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all\n",
      "safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely\n",
      "irresponsible.\n",
      "But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.\n",
      "When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. Technical\n",
      "progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. As\n",
      "we have seen, researches that could be called scientiﬁc are still carried out for\n",
      "the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their\n",
      "failure to show results is not important. Eﬃciency, even military eﬃciency, is\n",
      "no longer needed. Nothing is eﬃcient in Oceania except the Thought Police.\n",
      "Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in eﬀect a separate\n",
      "universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised.\n",
      "Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life — the need\n",
      "to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or\n",
      "stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and\n",
      "between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that\n",
      "is all. Cut oﬀfrom contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen\n",
      "of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which\n",
      "direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as\n",
      "the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their\n",
      "followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient,\n",
      "and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as\n",
      "their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into\n",
      "whatever shape they choose.\n",
      "The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is\n",
      "merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals\n",
      "whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one\n",
      "another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of\n",
      "consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a\n",
      "hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal aﬀair. In\n",
      "the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their\n",
      "common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did ﬁght against\n",
      "one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day\n",
      "they are not ﬁghting against one another at all. The war is waged by each\n",
      "ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make\n",
      "116\n",
      "\n",
      "or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact.\n",
      "The very word ’war’, therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be\n",
      "accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist.\n",
      "The\n",
      "peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age\n",
      "and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something\n",
      "quite diﬀerent. The eﬀect would be much the same if the three super-states,\n",
      "instead of ﬁghting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each\n",
      "inviolate within its own boundaries.\n",
      "For in that case each would still be a\n",
      "self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering inﬂuence of external\n",
      "danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent\n",
      "war. This — although the vast majority of Party members understand it only\n",
      "in a shallower sense — is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: War is Peace.\n",
      "Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a\n",
      "rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden\n",
      "book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn oﬀ.\n",
      "Solitude and safety\n",
      "were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body,\n",
      "the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that\n",
      "played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured\n",
      "him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the\n",
      "attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to\n",
      "set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to\n",
      "his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The\n",
      "best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already. He\n",
      "had just turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julia’s footstep on the stair\n",
      "and started out of his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on\n",
      "the ﬂoor and ﬂung herself into his arms. It was more than a week since they\n",
      "had seen one another.\n",
      "’I’ve got the book,’ he said as they disentangled themselves.\n",
      "’Oh, you’ve got it?\n",
      "Good,’ she said without much interest, and almost\n",
      "immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coﬀee.\n",
      "They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an\n",
      "hour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the\n",
      "counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape\n",
      "of boots on the ﬂagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winston had\n",
      "seen there on his ﬁrst visit was almost a ﬁxture in the yard. There seemed to be\n",
      "no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub\n",
      "and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth\n",
      "into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already\n",
      "on the point of falling asleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on\n",
      "the ﬂoor, and sat up against the bedhead.\n",
      "’We must read it,’ he said. ’You too. All members of the Brotherhood have\n",
      "to read it.’\n",
      "’You read it,’ she said with her eyes shut. ’Read it aloud. That’s the best\n",
      "way. Then you can explain it to me as you go.’\n",
      "The clock’s hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hours\n",
      "ahead of them. He propped the book against his knees and began reading:\n",
      "Chapter I\n",
      "Ignorance is Strength\n",
      "Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age,\n",
      "there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and\n",
      "117\n",
      "\n",
      "the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless\n",
      "diﬀerent names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards\n",
      "one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society\n",
      "has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable\n",
      "changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will\n",
      "always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed one way or the other\n",
      "’Julia, are you awake?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Yes, my love, I’m listening. Go on. It’s marvellous.’\n",
      "He continued reading:\n",
      "The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the\n",
      "High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places\n",
      "with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim — for it is an\n",
      "abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery\n",
      "to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives —\n",
      "is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.\n",
      "Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs\n",
      "over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power,\n",
      "but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their\n",
      "belief in themselves or their capacity to govern eﬃciently, or both. They are\n",
      "then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending\n",
      "to them that they are ﬁghting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have\n",
      "reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position\n",
      "of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group\n",
      "splits oﬀfrom one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle\n",
      "begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily\n",
      "successful in achieving their aims.\n",
      "It would be an exaggeration to say that\n",
      "throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today,\n",
      "in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better oﬀthan he\n",
      "was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners,\n",
      "no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.\n",
      "From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much\n",
      "more than a change in the name of their masters.\n",
      "By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become\n",
      "obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted\n",
      "history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalter-\n",
      "able law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents,\n",
      "but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a signiﬁcant\n",
      "change. In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the\n",
      "doctrine speciﬁcally of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats\n",
      "and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it\n",
      "had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world\n",
      "beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had al-\n",
      "ways made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however,\n",
      "the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not\n",
      "yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the\n",
      "past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then\n",
      "had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The\n",
      "new Middle groups in eﬀect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socialism,\n",
      "a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link\n",
      "in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was\n",
      "118\n",
      "\n",
      "still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of So-\n",
      "cialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty\n",
      "and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which\n",
      "appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism\n",
      "in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the con-\n",
      "scious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality. These new movements,\n",
      "of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-\n",
      "service to their ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress\n",
      "and freeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to\n",
      "happen once more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out\n",
      "by the Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious\n",
      "strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.\n",
      "The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical\n",
      "knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed\n",
      "before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now in-\n",
      "telligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable.\n",
      "But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the\n",
      "twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still\n",
      "true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had\n",
      "to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but\n",
      "there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large diﬀerences\n",
      "of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but\n",
      "desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of ma-\n",
      "chine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary\n",
      "for human beings to do diﬀerent kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for\n",
      "them to live at diﬀerent social or economic levels. Therefore, from the point of\n",
      "view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality\n",
      "was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more\n",
      "primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had\n",
      "been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an earthly paradise in which men\n",
      "should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute\n",
      "labour, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. And this\n",
      "vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually proﬁted by each\n",
      "historical change. The heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions\n",
      "had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of\n",
      "speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their con-\n",
      "duct to be inﬂuenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of\n",
      "the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authori-\n",
      "tarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when\n",
      "it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called\n",
      "itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening\n",
      "of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long aban-\n",
      "doned, in some cases for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the\n",
      "use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions,\n",
      "the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations-not only became\n",
      "common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered\n",
      "themselves enlightened and progressive.\n",
      "It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and\n",
      "counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged\n",
      "as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the\n",
      "119\n",
      "\n",
      "various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in\n",
      "the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the\n",
      "prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What kind of people would control this\n",
      "world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up for the most\n",
      "part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity\n",
      "experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These\n",
      "people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of\n",
      "the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world\n",
      "of monopoly industry and centralized government.\n",
      "As compared with their\n",
      "opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury,\n",
      "hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing\n",
      "and more intent on crushing opposition. This last diﬀerence was cardinal. By\n",
      "comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-\n",
      "hearted and ineﬃcient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent\n",
      "by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only\n",
      "the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even\n",
      "the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part\n",
      "of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep\n",

      "sidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party\n",
      "member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because\n",

      "for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the\n",
      "Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must\n",
      "be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the\n",
      "Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political\n",
      "alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one’s mind, or even one’s policy,\n",
      "is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it\n",
      "may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the en-\n",
      "emy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus history\n",
      "is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsiﬁcation of the past, carried out\n",
      "by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the\n",
      "work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.\n",
      "The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is\n",
      "argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in\n",
      "human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree\n",
      "upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full\n",
      "control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party\n",
      "chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has\n",
      "been altered in any speciﬁc instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever\n",
      "shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no diﬀerent\n",
      "past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the\n",
      "same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a\n",
      "year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the\n",
      "absolute can never have been diﬀerent from what it is now. It will be seen that\n",
      "the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To make\n",
      "sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely\n",
      "a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened\n",
      "in the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one’s memories or to\n",
      "tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done\n",
      "so.\n",
      "The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique.\n",
      "It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are\n",
      "intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ’reality\n",
      "control’. In Newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises\n",
      "much else as well.\n",
      "Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s\n",

      "or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink\n",

      "the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the Thought Police, continuous\n",
      "warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards.\n",
      "This motive really consists ... Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes\n",
      "aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some\n",
      "time past. She was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her\n",
      "cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her\n",

      "’Julia.\n",
      "No answer.\n",

      "He had still, he reﬂected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood\n",
      "how; he did not understand why. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actu-\n",
      "ally told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the\n",
      "knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew better than\n",
      "before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did\n",
      "not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung\n",
      "to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow beam\n",
      "from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow.\n",
      "He shut his eyes. The sun on his face and the girl’s smooth body touching his\n",
      "own gave him a strong, sleepy, conﬁdent feeling. He was safe, everything was\n",
      "all right. He fell asleep murmuring ’Sanity is not statistical,’ with the feeling\n",
      "that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. When he woke it was with\n",
      "the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned\n",

      "\n",
      "the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below;\n",
      "’It was only an ’opeless fancy,\n",
      "It passed like an Ipril dye,\n",
      "But a look an’ a word an’ the dreams they stirred\n",
      "They ’ave stolen my ’eart awye!’\n",
      "The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard it\n",
      "all over the place. It had outlived the Hate Song. Julia woke at the sound,\n",
      "stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.\n",
      "’I’m hungry,’ she said. ’Let’s make some more coﬀee. Damn! The stove’s\n",
      "gone out and the water’s cold.’ She picked the stove up and shook it. ’There’s\n",
      "no oil in it.’\n",
      "’We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.’\n",
      "’The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I’m going to put my clothes on,’\n",
      "she added. ’It seems to have got colder.’\n",
      "Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:\n",
      "’They sye that time ’eals all things,\n",
      "They sye you can always forget;\n",
      "But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years\n",
      "They twist my ’eart-strings yet!’\n",
      "As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. The\n",
      "sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the yard any\n",
      "longer. The ﬂagstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and he\n",
      "had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue\n",
      "between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking\n",
      "and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers,\n",
      "and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living or\n",
      "was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to\n",
      "his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy ﬁgure\n",
      "below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms\n",
      "reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck\n",
      "him for the ﬁrst time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to\n",
      "him that the body of a woman of ﬁfty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by\n",
      "childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain\n",
      "like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he\n",
      "thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the\n",
      "rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to\n",
      "the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the ﬂower?\n",
      "’She’s beautiful,’ he murmured.\n",
      "’She’s a metre across the hips, easily,’ said Julia.\n",
      "’That is her style of beauty,’ said Winston.\n",
      "He held Julia’s supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to\n",
      "the knee her ﬂank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would ever\n",
      "come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of mouth,\n",
      "from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down there\n",
      "had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly. He\n",
      "wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might easily be ﬁfteen.\n",
      "She had had her momentary ﬂowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and\n",
      "then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red\n",
      "and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking,\n",
      "sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, ﬁrst for children, then for\n",
      "127\n",
      "\n",
      "grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing.\n",
      "The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the\n",
      "aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into\n",
      "interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for\n",
      "everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky\n",
      "were also very much the same — everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of\n",
      "thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another’s\n",
      "existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the\n",
      "same — people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in\n",
      "their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the\n",
      "world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles! Without having read to the end\n",
      "of the book, he knew that that must be Goldstein’s ﬁnal message. The future\n",
      "belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that when their time came the\n",
      "world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as\n",
      "the world of the Party? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity.\n",
      "Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen,\n",
      "strength would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could\n",
      "not doubt it when you looked at that valiant ﬁgure in the yard. In the end\n",
      "their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a\n",
      "thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing\n",
      "on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not\n",
      "kill.\n",
      "’Do you remember,’ he said, ’the thrush that sang to us, that ﬁrst day, at\n",
      "the edge of the wood?’\n",
      "’He wasn’t singing to us,’ said Julia. ’He was singing to please himself. Not\n",
      "even that. He was just singing.’\n",
      "The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. All round the world,\n",
      "in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden\n",
      "lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages of the\n",
      "endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japan — everywhere stood\n",
      "the same solid unconquerable ﬁgure, made monstrous by work and childbearing,\n",
      "toiling from birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of\n",
      "conscious beings must one day come. You were the dead, theirs was the future.\n",
      "But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive\n",
      "the body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.\n",
      "’We are the dead,’ he said.\n",
      "’We are the dead,’ echoed Julia dutifully.\n",
      "’You are the dead,’ said an iron voice behind them.\n",
      "They sprang apart. Winston’s entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He\n",
      "could see the white all round the irises of Julia’s eyes. Her face had turned a\n",
      "milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out\n",
      "sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.\n",
      "’You are the dead,’ repeated the iron voice.\n",
      "’It was behind the picture,’ breathed Julia.\n",
      "’It was behind the picture,’ said the voice. ’Remain exactly where you are.\n",
      "Make no movement until you are ordered.’\n",
      "It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except stand\n",
      "gazing into one another’s eyes. To run for life, to get out of the house before\n",
      "it was too late — no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey\n",
      "the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch had been\n",
      "128\n",
      "\n",
      "turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen to the ﬂoor\n",
      "uncovering the telescreen behind it.\n",
      "’Now they can see us,’ said Julia.\n",
      "’ Now we can see you,’ said the voice. ’ Stand out in the middle of the room.\n",
      "Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch one\n",
      "another.’\n",
      "They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia’s body\n",
      "shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could just stop\n",
      "his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There was a\n",
      "sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. The yard seemed\n",
      "to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the stones. The woman’s\n",
      "singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though the\n",
      "washtub had been ﬂung across the yard, and then a confusion of angry shouts\n",
      "which ended in a yell of pain.\n",
      "’The house is surrounded,’ said Winston.\n",
      "’The house is surrounded,’ said the voice.\n",
      "He heard Julia snap her teeth together.\n",
      "’I suppose we may as well say\n",
      "good-bye,’ she said.\n",
      "’You may as well say good-bye,’ said the voice.\n",
      "And then another quite\n",
      "diﬀerent voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression of\n",
      "having heard before, struck in; ’And by the way, while we are on the subject,\n",
      "”Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop oﬀyour\n",
      "head”!’\n",
      "Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston’s back. The head of a\n",
      "ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Some-\n",
      "one was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the\n",
      "stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots\n",
      "on their feet and truncheons in their hands.\n",
      "Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One\n",
      "thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an excuse\n",
      "to hit you! A man with a smooth prize-ﬁghter’s jowl in which the mouth was\n",
      "only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between\n",
      "thumb and foreﬁnger. Winston met his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with\n",
      "one’s hands behind one’s head and one’s face and body all exposed, was almost\n",
      "unbearable.\n",
      "The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place\n",
      "where his lips should have been, and then passed on. There was another crash.\n",
      "Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to\n",
      "pieces on the hearth-stone.\n",
      "The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake,\n",
      "rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it always was!\n",
      "There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on\n",
      "the ankle which nearly ﬂung him oﬀhis balance. One of the men had smashed\n",
      "his ﬁst into Julia’s solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was\n",
      "thrashing about on the ﬂoor, ﬁghting for breath. Winston dared not turn his\n",
      "head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within\n",
      "the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain\n",
      "in his own body, the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the\n",
      "struggle to get back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing\n",
      "pain which was there all the while but could not be suﬀered yet, because before\n",
      "all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted\n",
      "129\n",
      "\n",
      "her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.\n",
      "Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the\n",
      "eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last\n",
      "he saw of her.\n",
      "He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their\n",
      "own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to ﬂit through his mind. He\n",
      "wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had\n",
      "done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate,\n",
      "and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago.\n",
      "He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one.\n",
      "But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fading at twenty-one\n",
      "hours on an August evening? He wondered whether after all he and Julia had\n",
      "mistaken the time — had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty\n",
      "when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. But he did not\n",
      "pursue the thought further. It was not interesting.\n",
      "There ws another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into\n",
      "the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more\n",
      "subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington’s appearance. His\n",
      "eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.\n",
      "’Pick up those pieces,’ he said sharply.\n",
      "A man stooped to obey.\n",
      "The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston\n",
      "suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on\n",
      "the telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his\n",
      "hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not wearing\n",
      "his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his\n",
      "identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was still recognizable,\n",
      "but he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and\n",
      "seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that\n",
      "had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. The black eyebrows were\n",
      "less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have\n",
      "altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man of\n",
      "about ﬁve-and-thirty. It occurred to Winston that for the ﬁrst time in his life\n",
      "he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.\n",
      "130\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 18\n",
      "He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love,\n",
      "but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged windowless\n",
      "cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps ﬂooded it with\n",
      "cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had\n",
      "something to do with the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit\n",
      "on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the\n",
      "door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in\n",
      "each wall.\n",
      "There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they had\n",
      "bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also hungry,\n",
      "with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours\n",
      "since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, probably never\n",
      "would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him.\n",
      "Since he was arrested he had not been fed.\n",
      "He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his\n",
      "knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected movements\n",
      "they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food was growing\n",
      "upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He had an idea\n",
      "that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. It was even\n",
      "possible — he thought this because from time to time something seemed to\n",
      "tickle his leg — that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the end the\n",
      "temptation to ﬁnd out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket.\n",
      "’Smith!’ yelled a voice from the telescreen. ’6079 Smith W.! Hands out of\n",
      "pockets in the cells!’\n",
      "He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought here\n",
      "he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison\n",
      "or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols.\n",
      "He did not know how long he\n",
      "had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was\n",
      "hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling place. They had put him\n",
      "into a cell similar to the one he was now in, but ﬁlthily dirty and at all times\n",
      "crowded by ten or ﬁfteen people. The majority of them were common criminals,\n",
      "but there were a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against\n",
      "the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his\n",
      "belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing\n",
      "diﬀerence in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party\n",
      "prisoners were always silent and terriﬁed, but the ordinary criminals seemed\n",
      "to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back\n",
      "131\n",
      "\n",
      "ﬁercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the\n",
      "ﬂoor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in\n",
      "their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore\n",
      "order.\n",
      "On the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with\n",
      "the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through\n",
      "the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminals with\n",
      "a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly.\n",
      "There\n",
      "was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners\n",
      "expected to be sent. It was ’all right’ in the camps, he gathered, so long as you\n",
      "had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and\n",
      "racketeering of every kind, there was homosexuality and prostitution, there was\n",
      "even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given\n",
      "only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who\n",
      "formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.\n",
      "There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description: drug-\n",
      "peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the\n",
      "drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress\n",
      "them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling\n",
      "breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles,\n",
      "was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one\n",
      "at each corner. They wrenched oﬀthe boots with which she had been trying\n",
      "to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston’s lap, almost breaking his\n",
      "thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a\n",
      "yell of ’F— bastards!’ Then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven,\n",
      "she slid oﬀWinston’s knees on to the bench.\n",
      "’Beg pardon, dearie,’ she said. ’I wouldn’t ’a sat on you, only the buggers\n",
      "put me there. They dono ’ow to treat a lady, do they?’ She paused, patted her\n",
      "breast, and belched. ’Pardon,’ she said, ’I ain’t meself, quite.’\n",
      "She leant forward and vomited copiously on the ﬂoor.\n",
      "’Thass better,’ she said, leaning back with closed eyes. ’Never keep it down,\n",
      "thass what I say. Get it up while it’s fresh on your stomach, like.’\n",
      "She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immedi-\n",
      "ately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew\n",
      "him towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.\n",
      "’Wass your name, dearie?’ she said.\n",
      "’Smith,’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Smith?’ said the woman. ’Thass funny. My name’s Smith too. Why,’ she\n",
      "added sentimentally, ’I might be your mother!’\n",
      "She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age\n",
      "and physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty\n",
      "years in a forced-labour camp.\n",
      "No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary criminals\n",
      "ignored the Party prisoners.\n",
      "’The polits,’ they called them, with a sort of\n",
      "uninterested contempt.\n",
      "The Party prisoners seemed terriﬁed of speaking to\n",
      "anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only once, when two Party\n",
      "members, both women, were pressed close together on the bench, he overheard\n",
      "amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a\n",
      "reference to something called ’room one-oh-one’, which he did not understand.\n",
      "It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The dull\n",
      "pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and sometimes\n",
      "132\n",
      "\n",
      "worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly.\n",
      "When it grew\n",
      "worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food. When it\n",
      "grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments when he foresaw the\n",
      "things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped\n",
      "and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and\n",
      "iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the ﬂoor, screaming\n",
      "for mercy through broken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not ﬁx\n",
      "his mind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but that was only\n",
      "a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and\n",
      "he hardly even wondered what was happening to her. He thought oftener of\n",
      "O’Brien, with a ﬂickering hope. O’Brien might know that he had been arrested.\n",
      "The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. But there was\n",
      "the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. There would\n",
      "be perhaps ﬁve seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade\n",
      "would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the ﬁngers that\n",
      "held it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which\n",
      "shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use\n",
      "the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist from\n",
      "moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes’ life even with the certainty\n",
      "that there was torture at the end of it.\n",
      "Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls\n",
      "of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at some point\n",
      "or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it\n",
      "was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and\n",
      "at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In this place, he knew\n",
      "instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with no\n",
      "darkness: he saw now why O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In\n",
      "the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be at the heart of\n",
      "the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten ﬂoors below ground, or\n",
      "thirty above it. He moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to\n",
      "determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or\n",
      "buried deep underground.\n",
      "There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with a\n",
      "clang. A young oﬃcer, a trim black-uniformed ﬁgure who seemed to glitter all\n",
      "over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a wax\n",
      "mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the guards outside\n",
      "to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into\n",
      "the cell. The door clanged shut again.\n",
      "Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as\n",
      "though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then\n",
      "began to wander up and down the cell.\n",
      "He had not yet noticed Winston’s\n",
      "presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the\n",
      "level of Winston’s head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking out of\n",
      "the holes in his socks. He was also several days away from a shave. A scrubby\n",
      "beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruﬃanism that\n",
      "went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements.\n",
      "Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy. He must speak to Am-\n",
      "pleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even conceivable that\n",
      "Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.\n",
      "’Ampleforth,’ he said.\n",
      "133\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled.\n",
      "His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.\n",
      "’Ah, Smith!’ he said. ’You too!’\n",
      "’What are you in for?’\n",
      "’To tell you the truth — ’ He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite\n",
      "Winston. ’There is only one oﬀence, is there not?’ he said.\n",
      "’And have you committed it?’\n",
      "’Apparently I have.’\n",
      "He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as\n",
      "though trying to remember something.\n",
      "’These things happen,’ he began vaguely. ’I have been able to recall one\n",
      "instance — a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We were\n",
      "producing a deﬁnitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word ”God”\n",
      "to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!’ he added almost indignantly,\n",
      "raising his face to look at Winston. ’It was impossible to change the line. The\n",
      "rhyme was ”rod”. Do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to ”rod”\n",
      "in the entire language? For days I had racked my brains. There was no other\n",
      "rhyme.’\n",
      "The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for\n",
      "a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of\n",
      "the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and\n",
      "scrubby hair.\n",
      "’Has it ever occurred to you,’ he said, ’that the whole history of English\n",
      "poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks rhymes?’\n",
      "No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the\n",
      "circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.\n",
      "’Do you know what time of day it is?’ he said.\n",
      "Ampleforth looked startled again. ’I had hardly thought about it. They\n",
      "arrested me — it could be two days ago — perhaps three.’ His eyes ﬂitted round\n",
      "the walls, as though he half expected to ﬁnd a window somewhere. ’There is\n",
      "no diﬀerence between night and day in this place. I do not see how one can\n",
      "calculate the time.’\n",
      "They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason,\n",
      "a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands\n",
      "crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, ﬁdgeted\n",
      "from side to side, clasping his lank hands ﬁrst round one knee, then round\n",
      "the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still. Time passed. Twenty\n",
      "minutes, an hour — it was diﬃcult to judge. Once more there was a sound of\n",
      "boots outside. Winston’s entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in ﬁve\n",
      "minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had\n",
      "come.\n",
      "The door opened. The cold-faced young oﬃcer stepped into the cell. With\n",
      "a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.\n",
      "’Room 101,’ he said.\n",
      "Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely per-\n",
      "turbed, but uncomprehending.\n",
      "What seemed like a long time passed.\n",
      "The pain in Winston’s belly had\n",
      "revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling\n",
      "again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The\n",
      "pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O’Brien ; Julia;\n",
      "134\n",
      "\n",
      "the razor blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were\n",
      "approaching. As the door opened, the wave of air that it created brought in\n",
      "a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was wearing\n",
      "khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.\n",
      "This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.\n",
      "’You here!’ he said.\n",
      "Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor sur-\n",
      "prise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable\n",
      "to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that\n",
      "they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look, as though he could\n",
      "not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance.\n",
      "’What are you in for?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Thoughtcrime!’\n",
      "said Parsons, almost blubbering.\n",
      "The tone of his voice\n",
      "implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror\n",
      "that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston and\n",
      "began eagerly appealing to him: ’You don’t think they’ll shoot me, do you,\n",
      "old chap? They don’t shoot you if you haven’t actually done anything — only\n",
      "thoughts, which you can’t help? I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I\n",
      "trust them for that! They’ll know my record, won’t they? You know what kind\n",
      "of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course, but keen. I\n",
      "tried to do my best for the Party, didn’t I? I’ll get oﬀwith ﬁve years, don’t you\n",
      "think? Or even ten years? A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in\n",
      "a labour-camp. They wouldn’t shoot me for going oﬀthe rails just once?’\n",
      "’Are you guilty?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’Of course I’m guilty!’ cried Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen.\n",
      "’You don’t think the Party would arrest an innocent man, do you?’ His frog-\n",
      "like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression.\n",
      "’Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,’ he said sententiously. ’It’s insid-\n",
      "ious. It can get hold of you without your even knowing it. Do you know how\n",
      "it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes, that’s a fact. There I was, working away,\n",
      "trying to do my bit — never knew I had any bad stuﬀin my mind at all. And\n",
      "then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?’\n",
      "He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter\n",
      "an obscenity.\n",
      "”Down with Big Brother!” Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again, it\n",
      "seems. Between you and me, old man, I’m glad they got me before it went any\n",
      "further. Do you know what I’m going to say to them when I go up before the\n",
      "tribunal? ”Thank you,” I’m going to say, ”thank you for saving me before it\n",
      "was too late.”\n",
      "’Who denounced you?’ said Winston.\n",
      "’It was my little daughter,’ said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride. ’She\n",
      "listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped oﬀto the patrols\n",
      "the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don’t bear her any\n",
      "grudge for it. In fact I’m proud of her. It shows I brought her up in the right\n",
      "spirit, anyway.’\n",
      "He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting\n",
      "a longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.\n",
      "’Excuse me, old man,’ he said. ’I can’t help it. It’s the waiting.’\n",
      "He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered his\n",
      "face with his hands.\n",
      "135\n",
      "\n",
      "’Smith!’ yelled the voice from the telescreen. ’6079 Smith W! Uncover your\n",
      "face. No faces covered in the cells.’\n",
      "Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abun-\n",
      "dantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abom-\n",
      "inably for hours afterwards.\n",
      "Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a\n",
      "woman, was consigned to ’Room 101’, and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel\n",
      "and turn a diﬀerent colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if\n",
      "it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if\n",
      "it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners in\n",
      "the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man\n",
      "with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harmless rodent.\n",
      "His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was diﬃcult not\n",
      "to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey\n",
      "eyes ﬂitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when\n",
      "he caught anyone’s eye.\n",
      "The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance\n",
      "sent a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking\n",
      "man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what\n",
      "was startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of\n",
      "its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes\n",
      "seemed ﬁlled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something.\n",
      "The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston\n",
      "did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in his\n",
      "mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized\n",
      "what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The same thought\n",
      "seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. There was a\n",
      "very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man\n",
      "kept ﬂitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being\n",
      "dragged back by an irresistible attraction. Presently he began to ﬁdget on his\n",
      "seat. At last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the\n",
      "pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread\n",
      "to the skull- faced man.\n",
      "There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man\n",
      "jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind\n",
      "his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.\n",
      "’Bumstead!’ roared the voice. ’2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of\n",
      "bread!’\n",
      "The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the ﬂoor.\n",
      "’Remain standing where you are,’ said the voice. ’Face the door. Make no\n",
      "movement.’\n",
      "The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrol-\n",
      "lably. The door clanged open. As the young oﬃcer entered and stepped aside,\n",
      "there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and\n",
      "shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal\n",
      "from the oﬃcer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind\n",
      "it, full in the chinless man’s mouth. The force of it seemed almost to knock him\n",
      "clear of the ﬂoor. His body was ﬂung across the cell and fetched up against the\n",
      "base of the lavatory seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark\n",
      "blood oozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking,\n",
      "136\n",
      "\n",
      "which seemed unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised\n",
      "himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the\n",
      "two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.\n",
      "The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The chin-\n",
      "less man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the ﬂesh was\n",
      "darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a\n",
      "black hole in the middle of it.\n",
      "From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls. His\n",
      "grey eyes still ﬂitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he\n",
      "were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation.\n",
      "The door opened. With a small gesture the oﬃcer indicated the skull-faced\n",
      "man.\n",
      "’Room 101,’ he said.\n",
      "There was a gasp and a ﬂurry at Winston’s side. The man had actually\n",
      "ﬂung himself on his knees on the ﬂoor, with his hand clasped together.\n",
      "’Comrade! Oﬃcer!’ he cried. ’You don’t have to take me to that place!\n",
      "Haven’t I told you everything already?\n",
      "What else is it you want to know?\n",
      "There’s nothing I wouldn’t confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and I’ll\n",
      "confess straight oﬀ. Write it down and I’ll sign it — anything! Not room 101!’\n",
      "’Room 101,’ said the oﬃcer.\n",
      "The man’s face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have\n",
      "believed possible. It was deﬁnitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.\n",
      "’Do anything to me!’ he yelled. ’You’ve been starving me for weeks. Finish\n",
      "it oﬀand let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-ﬁve years. Is\n",
      "there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I’ll tell\n",
      "you anything you want. I don’t care who it is or what you do to them. I’ve got\n",
      "a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn’t six years old. You can take\n",
      "the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I’ll stand\n",
      "by and watch it. But not Room 101!’\n",
      "’Room 101,’ said the oﬃcer.\n",
      "The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with\n",
      "some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes settled\n",
      "on the smashed face of the chinless man. He ﬂung out a lean arm.\n",
      "’That’s the one you ought to be taking, not me!’ he shouted. ’You didn’t\n",
      "hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and I’ll\n",
      "tell you every word of it. He’s the one that’s against the Party, not me.’ The\n",
      "guards stepped forward. The man’s voice rose to a shriek. ’You didn’t hear\n",
      "him!’ he repeated. ’Something went wrong with the telescreen. He’s the one\n",
      "you want. Take him, not me!’\n",
      "The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at\n",
      "this moment he ﬂung himself across the ﬂoor of the cell and grabbed one of the\n",
      "iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like an\n",
      "animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with\n",
      "astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him.\n",
      "The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight in\n",
      "front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything\n",
      "except hanging on. Then there was a diﬀerent kind of cry. A kick from a guard’s\n",
      "boot had broken the ﬁngers of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.\n",
      "’Room 101,’ said the oﬃcer.\n",
      "137\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his\n",
      "crushed hand, all the ﬁght had gone out of him.\n",
      "A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was\n",
      "taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was alone,\n",
      "and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such\n",
      "that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece\n",
      "of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning it\n",
      "needed a hard eﬀort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst.\n",
      "His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying\n",
      "white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He\n",
      "would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then\n",
      "would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of\n",
      "staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control\n",
      "the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O’Brien and\n",
      "the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed\n",
      "in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or\n",
      "other she was suﬀering perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with\n",
      "pain at this moment. He thought: ’If I could save Julia by doubling my own\n",
      "pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.’ But that was merely an intellectual decision,\n",
      "taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it. In this place\n",
      "you could not feel anything, except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides,\n",
      "was it possible, when you were actually suﬀering it, to wish for any reason that\n",
      "your own pain should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.\n",
      "The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O’Brien came in.\n",
      "Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out\n",
      "of him. For the ﬁrst time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen.\n",
      "’They’ve got you too!’ he cried.\n",
      "’They got me a long time ago,’ said O’Brien with a mild, almost regretful\n",
      "irony. He stepped aside. from behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard\n",
      "with a long black truncheon in his hand.\n",
      "’You know him, Winston,’ said O’Brien. ’Don’t deceive yourself. You did\n",
      "know it — you have always known it.’\n",
      "Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of\n",
      "that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard’s hand. It might fall\n",
      "anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow-\n",
      "The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the\n",
      "stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow light.\n",
      "Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! The light\n",
      "cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The guard was\n",
      "laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was answered. Never, for\n",
      "any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could\n",
      "wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as\n",
      "physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought\n",
      "over and over as he writhed on the ﬂoor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left\n",

      "move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. O’Brien\n",
      "was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At the other side of him\n",
      "stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.\n",
      "Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually.\n",
      "He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite diﬀerent\n",
      "world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down\n",
      "there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested him he had not\n",
      "seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not continuous. There\n",
      "had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one\n",
      "has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. But\n",
      "whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way\n",
      "of knowing.\n",
      "With that ﬁrst blow on the elbow the nightmare had started.\n",
      "Later he\n",
      "was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine\n",
      "interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long\n",
      "range of crimes — espionage, sabotage, and the like — to which everyone had\n",
      "to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality, though the\n",
      "torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings\n",
      "had continued, he could not remember. Always there were ﬁve or six men in\n",
      "black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was ﬁsts, sometimes it was\n",
      "truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were\n",
      "times when he rolled about the ﬂoor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his\n",
      "body this way and that in an endless, hopeless eﬀort to dodge the kicks, and\n",
      "simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows,\n",
      "on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine.\n",
      "There were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable\n",
      "thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he\n",
      "could not force hirnself into losing consciousness. There were times when his\n",
      "nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating\n",
      "began, when the mere sight of a ﬁst drawn back for a blow was enough to make\n",
      "him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other\n",
      "times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every\n",
      "word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times\n",
      "when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ’I will confess, but\n",
      "not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks,\n",
      "139\n",
      "\n",
      "two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.’ Sometimes he was\n",
      "beaten till he could hardly stand, then ﬂung like a sack of potatoes on to the\n",
      "stone ﬂoor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and\n",
      "beaten again. There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them\n",
      "dimly, because they were spent chieﬂy in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell\n",
      "with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-\n",
      "basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coﬀee. He remembered\n",
      "a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike,\n",
      "unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reﬂexes, turning\n",
      "up his eyelids, running harsh ﬁngers over him in search for broken bones, and\n",
      "shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep.\n",
      "The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to\n",
      "which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatis-\n",

      "His questioners now were not ruﬃans in black uniforms but Party\n",
      "intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and ﬂashing spectacles,\n",
      "who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted — he thought, he could\n",
      "not be sure — ten or twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw\n",
      "to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chieﬂy pain that they\n",
      "relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears. pulled his hair, made him\n",
      "stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face\n",
      "until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him\n",
      "and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the\n",
      "merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up,\n",
      "laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every\n",
      "step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame\n",
      "as from nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single\n",
      "session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every\n",
      "hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would\n",
      "suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of\n",
      "Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not\n",
      "enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done.\n",
      "When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could\n",
      "reduce him to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down\n",
      "more completely than the boots and ﬁsts of the guards. He became simply a\n",
      "mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him. His\n",
      "sole concern was to ﬁnd out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess\n",
      "it quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of\n",
      "eminent Party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement\n",
      "of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed\n",
      "that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as\n",
      "1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism,\n",
      "and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although\n",
      "he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive.\n",
      "He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and\n",
      "had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost\n",
      "every human being he had ever known. It was easier to confess everything and\n",
      "implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he\n",
      "had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no\n",
      "distinction between the thought and the deed.\n",
      "There were also memories of another kind.\n",
      "They stood out in his mind\n",
      "140\n",
      "\n",
      "disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.\n",
      "He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could\n",
      "see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of instrument was\n",
      "ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly\n",
      "he ﬂoated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.\n",
      "He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A\n",
      "man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots\n",
      "outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced oﬃcer marched in, followed\n",
      "by two guards.\n",
      "’Room 101,’ said the oﬃcer.\n",
      "The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston\n",
      "either; he was looking only at the dials.\n",
      "He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,\n",
      "golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of\n",
      "his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded in\n",
      "holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his life\n",
      "to an audience who knew it already.\n",
      "With him were the guards, the other\n",
      "questioners, the men in white coats, O’Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling\n",
      "down the corridor together and shouting with laughter. Some dreadful thing\n",
      "which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had\n",
      "not happened. Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail\n",
      "of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.\n",
      "He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had\n",
      "heard O’Brien’s voice. All through his interrogation, although he had never\n",
      "seen him, he had had the feeling that O’Brien was at his elbow, just out of\n",
      "sight. It was O’Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the\n",
      "guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It was he\n",
      "who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a\n",
      "respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should\n",
      "be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and suggested the\n",
      "answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor,\n",
      "he was the friend. And once — Winston could not remember whether it was\n",
      "in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness — a\n",
      "voice murmured in his ear: ’Don’t worry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For\n",
      "seven years I have watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall\n",
      "save you, I shall make you perfect.’ He was not sure whether it was O’Brien’s\n",
      "voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, ’We shall meet in the\n",
      "place where there is no darkness,’ in that other dream, seven years ago.\n",
      "He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period\n",
      "of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually\n",
      "materialized round him. He was almost ﬂat on his back, and unable to move.\n",
      "His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head\n",
      "was gripped in some manner. O’Brien was looking down at him gravely and\n",
      "rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches\n",
      "under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winston\n",
      "had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or ﬁfty. Under his hand there was\n",
      "a dial with a lever on top and ﬁgures running round the face.\n",
      "’I told you,’ said O’Brien, ’that if we met again it would be here.’\n",
      "’Yes,’ said Winston.\n",
      "Without any warning except a slight movement of O’Brien’s hand, a wave of\n",
      "141\n",
      "\n",
      "pain ﬂooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see what\n",
      "was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done\n",
      "to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether\n",
      "the eﬀect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of\n",
      "shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had brought\n",
      "the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone\n",
      "was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying\n",
      "to keep silent as long as possible.\n",
      "’You are afraid,’ said O’Brien, watching his face, ’that in another moment\n",
      "something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone.\n",
      "You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal\n",
      "ﬂuid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it not, Winston?’\n",
      "Winston did not answer. O’Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave\n",
      "of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.\n",
      "’That was forty,’ said O’Brien. ’You can see that the numbers on this dial\n",
      "run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation,\n",
      "that I have it in my power to inﬂict pain on you at any moment and to whatever\n",
      "degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in any way,\n",
      "or even fall below your usual level of intelligence, you will cry out with pain,\n",
      "instantly. Do you understand that?’\n",
      "’Yes,’ said Winston.\n",
      "O’Brien’s manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles thought-\n",
      "fully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice was gentle\n",
      "and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to\n",
      "explain and persuade rather than to punish.\n",
      "’I am taking trouble with you, Winston,’ he said, ’because you are worth\n",
      "trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have known\n",
      "it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are mentally\n",
      "deranged. You suﬀer from a defective memory. You are unable to remember\n",
      "real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which\n",
      "never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never cured yourself of it,\n",
      "because you did not choose to. There was a small eﬀort of the will that you\n",
      "were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, you are clinging to your\n",
      "disease under the impression that it is a virtue. Now we will take an example.\n",
      "At this moment, which power is Oceania at war with?’\n",
      "’When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.\n",
      "’With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia,\n",
      "has it not?’\n",
      "Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did\n",
      "not speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.\n",
      "’The truth, please, Winston.\n",
      "Your truth.\n",
      "Tell me what you think you\n",
      "remember.’\n",
      "’I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at\n",
      "war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was against\n",
      "Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that — ’\n",
      "O’Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.\n",
      "’Another example,’ he said. ’Some years ago you had a very serious delusion\n",
      "indeed. You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named\n",
      "Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford men who were executed for treachery and\n",
      "sabotage after making the fullest possible confession — were not guilty of the\n",
      "142\n",
      "\n",
      "crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen unmistakable\n",
      "documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false. There was a\n",
      "certain photograph about which you had a hallucination. You believed that you\n",
      "had actually held it in your hands. It was a photograph something like this.’\n",
      "An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O’Brien’s ﬁngers. For\n",
      "perhaps ﬁve seconds it was within the angle of Winston’s vision.\n",
      "It was a\n",
      "photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was the photograph.\n",
      "It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at\n",
      "the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago\n",
      "and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was\n",
      "out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made\n",
      "a desperate, agonizing eﬀort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was\n",
      "impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment\n",
      "he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in\n",
      "his ﬁngers again, or at least to see it.\n",
      "’It exists!’ he cried.\n",
      "’No,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall.\n",
      "O’Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on\n",
      "the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a ﬂash of ﬂame. O’Brien turned\n",
      "away from the wall.\n",
      "’Ashes,’ he said. ’Not even identiﬁable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It\n",
      "never existed.’\n",
      "’But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You\n",
      "remember it.’\n",
      "’I do not remember it,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "Winston’s heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly\n",
      "helplessness. If he could have been certain that O’Brien was lying, it would not\n",
      "have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O’Brien had really\n",
      "forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his\n",
      "denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. How could one be\n",
      "sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind\n",
      "could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.\n",
      "O’Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the\n",
      "air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.\n",
      "’There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past,’ he said. ’Repeat\n",
      "it, if you please.’\n",
      "”Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls\n",
      "the past,” repeated Winston obediently.\n",
      "”Who controls the present controls the past,” said O’Brien, nodding his\n",
      "head with slow approval. ’Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has real\n",
      "existence?’\n",
      "Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes ﬂitted\n",
      "towards the dial. He not only did not know whether ’yes’ or ’no’ was the answer\n",
      "that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed\n",
      "to be the true one.\n",
      "O’Brien smiled faintly. ’You are no metaphysician, Winston,’ he said. ’Until\n",
      "this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I will put it\n",
      "more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere or\n",
      "other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?’\n",
      "143\n",
      "\n",
      "’No.’\n",
      "’Then where does the past exist, if at all?’\n",
      "’In records. It is written down.’\n",
      "’In records. And- ?’\n",
      "’In the mind. In human memories.\n",
      "’In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we\n",
      "control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?’\n",
      "’But how can you stop people remembering things?’ cried Winston again\n",
      "momentarily forgetting the dial. ’It is involuntary. It is outside oneself. How\n",
      "can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!’\n",
      "O’Brien’s manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.\n",
      "’On the contrary,’ he said, ’you have not controlled it. That is what has\n",
      "brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in self-\n",
      "discipline.\n",
      "You would not make the act of submission which is the price of\n",
      "sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the disciplined\n",
      "mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective,\n",
      "external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality\n",
      "is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something,\n",
      "you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you.\n",
      "But I tell you,\n",
      "Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and\n",
      "nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in\n",
      "any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and\n",
      "immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible\n",
      "to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact\n",
      "that you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an\n",
      "eﬀort of the will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.’\n",
      "He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying\n",
      "to sink in.\n",
      "’Do you remember,’ he went on, ’ writing in your diary, ”Freedom is the\n",
      "freedom to say that two plus two make four”?’\n",
      "’Yes,’ said Winston.\n",
      "O’Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb\n",
      "hidden and the four ﬁngers extended.\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers am I holding up, Winston?\n",
      "’Four.’\n",
      "’And if the party says that it is not four but ﬁve — then how many?’\n",
      "’Four.’\n",
      "The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to\n",
      "ﬁfty-ﬁve. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston’s body. The air tore into\n",
      "his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he\n",
      "could not stop. O’Brien watched him, the four ﬁngers still extended. He drew\n",
      "back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers, Winston?’\n",
      "’Four.’\n",
      "The needle went up to sixty.\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers, Winston?’\n",
      "’Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!’\n",
      "The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy, stern\n",
      "face and the four ﬁngers ﬁlled his vision. The ﬁngers stood up before his eyes\n",
      "like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.\n",
      "144\n",
      "\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers, Winston?’\n",
      "’Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!’\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers, Winston?’\n",
      "’Five! Five! Five!’\n",
      "’No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are four.\n",
      "How many ﬁngers, please?’\n",
      "’Four! ﬁve! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!\n",
      "Abruptly he was sitting up with O’Brien’s arm round his shoulders.\n",
      "He\n",
      "had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his\n",
      "body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his\n",
      "teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a moment\n",
      "he clung to O’Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round\n",
      "his shoulders. He had the feeling that O’Brien was his protector, that the pain\n",
      "was something that came from outside, from some other source, and that it was\n",
      "O’Brien who would save him from it.\n",
      "’You are a slow learner, Winston,’ said O’Brien gently.\n",
      "’How can I help it?’ he blubbered. ’How can I help seeing what is in front\n",
      "of my eyes? Two and two are four.\n",
      "Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are ﬁve. Sometimes they are three.\n",
      "Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to\n",
      "become sane.’\n",
      "He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again, but\n",
      "the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely\n",
      "weak and cold. O’Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat,\n",
      "who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in the white\n",
      "coat bent down and looked closely into Winston’s eyes, felt his pulse, laid an\n",
      "ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he nodded to O’Brien.\n",
      "’Again,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "The pain ﬂowed into Winston’s body.\n",
      "The needle must be at seventy,\n",
      "seventy-ﬁve. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the ﬁngers were\n",
      "still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the\n",
      "spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. The\n",
      "pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O’Brien had drawn back the lever.\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers, Winston?’\n",
      "’Four. I suppose there are four. I would see ﬁve if I could. I am trying to\n",
      "see ﬁve.’\n",
      "’Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see ﬁve, or really to see them?’\n",
      "’Really to see them.’\n",
      "’Again,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "Perhaps the needle was eighty — ninety. Winston could not intermittently\n",
      "remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of\n",
      "ﬁngers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing\n",
      "behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying to count them, he\n",
      "could not remember why. He knew only that it was impossible to count them,\n",
      "and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between ﬁve and\n",
      "four. The pain died down again. When he opened his eyes it was to ﬁnd that\n",
      "he was still seeing the same thing. Innumerable ﬁngers, like moving trees, were\n",
      "still streaming past in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes\n",
      "again.\n",
      "’How many ﬁngers am I holding up, Winston?’\n",
      "145\n",
      "\n",
      "’I don’t know. I don’t know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four,\n",
      "ﬁve, six — in all honesty I don’t know.’\n",
      "’Better,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "A needle slid into Winston’s arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful, heal-\n",
      "ing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already half-forgotten.\n",
      "He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O’Brien. At sight of the heavy,\n",
      "lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. If he could\n",
      "have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O’Brien arm. He\n",
      "had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he\n",
      "had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that it bottom it did not matter whether\n",
      "O’Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O’Brien was a person who\n",
      "could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be\n",
      "understood. O’Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little\n",
      "while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no diﬀerence. In\n",
      "some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere\n",
      "or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place\n",
      "where they could meet and talk. O’Brien was looking down at him with an\n",
      "expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind.\n",
      "When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.\n",
      "’Do you know where you are, Winston?’ he said.\n",
      "’I don’t know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.’\n",
      "’Do you know how long you have been here?’\n",
      "’I don’t know. Days, weeks, months — I think it is months.’\n",
      "’And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?’\n",
      "’To make them confess.’\n",
      "’No, that is not the reason. Try again.’\n",
      "’To punish them.’\n",
      "’No!’ exclaimed O’Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face\n",
      "had suddenly become both stern and animated. ’No! Not merely to extract your\n",
      "confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here? To\n",
      "cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom\n",
      "we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in\n",
      "those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in\n",
      "the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy our\n",
      "enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I mean by that?’\n",
      "He was bending over Winston.\n",
      "His face looked enormous because of its\n",
      "nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below.\n",
      "Moreover it\n",
      "was ﬁlled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston’s heart\n",
      "shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. He\n",
      "felt certain that O’Brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness.\n",
      "At this moment, however, O’Brien turned away. He took a pace or two up and\n",
      "down. Then he continued less vehemently:\n",
      "’The ﬁrst thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no\n",
      "martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In the\n",
      "Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate\n",
      "heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake,\n",
      "thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed\n",
      "its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in\n",
      "fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because\n",
      "they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged\n",
      "146\n",
      "\n",
      "to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in\n",
      "the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There\n",
      "were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted\n",
      "heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that\n",
      "they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that\n",
      "one must not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial,\n",
      "they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down\n",
      "by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing\n",
      "whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing\n",
      "and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a\n",
      "few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become\n",
      "martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the\n",
      "ﬁrst place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted\n",
      "and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that\n",
      "are uttered here are true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow\n",
      "the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will\n",
      "vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted\n",
      "clean out from the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you\n",
      "into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not\n",
      "a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the\n",
      "future. You will never have existed.’\n",
      "Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bit-\n",
      "terness. O’Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought\n",
      "aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.\n",
      "’You are thinking,’ he said, ’that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so\n",
      "that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest diﬀerence — in that case,\n",
      "why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you ﬁrst? That is what you were\n",
      "thinking, was it not?’\n",
      "’Yes,’ said Winston.\n",
      "O’Brien smiled slightly. ’You are a ﬂaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a\n",
      "stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are diﬀerent\n",
      "from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience,\n",
      "nor even with the most abject submission. When ﬁnally you surrender to us,\n",
      "it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he\n",
      "resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we\n",
      "capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all illusion out\n",
      "of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart\n",
      "and soul. We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable\n",
      "to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however\n",
      "secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit\n",
      "any deviation. In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic,\n",
      "proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges\n",
      "could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage\n",
      "waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out.\n",
      "The command of the old despotisms was ”Thou shalt not”. The command of the\n",
      "totalitarians was ”Thou shalt”. Our command is ”Thou art”. No one whom we\n",
      "bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean. Even\n",
      "those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed — Jones,\n",
      "Aaronson, and Rutherford — in the end we broke them down.\n",
      "I took part\n",
      "in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering,\n",
      "147\n",
      "\n",
      "grovelling, weeping — and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with\n",
      "penitence. By the time we had ﬁnished with them they were only the shells of\n",
      "men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and\n",
      "love of Big Brother. It was touching to see how they loved him. They begged\n",
      "to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean.’\n",
      "His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusi-\n",
      "asm, was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not\n",
      "a hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was\n",
      "the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy yet\n",
      "graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his vision. O’Brien\n",
      "was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no idea that he had\n",
      "ever had, or could have, that O’Brien had not long ago known, examined, and\n",
      "rejected. His mind contained Winston’s mind. But in that case how could it be\n",
      "true that O’Brien was mad? It must be he, Winston, who was mad. O’Brien\n",
      "halted and looked down at him. His voice had grown stern again.\n",
      "’Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely\n",
      "you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And even\n",
      "if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never\n",
      "escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. Understand that in\n",
      "advance. We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming\n",
      "back. Things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived\n",
      "a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.\n",
      "Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love,\n",
      "or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity.\n",
      "You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall ﬁll you with\n",
      "ourselves.’\n",
      "He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware\n",
      "of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head.\n",
      "O’Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a level\n",
      "with Winston’s.\n",
      "’Three thousand,’ he said, speaking over Winston’s head to the man in the\n",
      "white coat.\n",
      "Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against Win-\n",
      "ston’s temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain. O’Brien\n",
      "laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.\n",
      "’This time it will not hurt,’ he said. ’Keep your eyes ﬁxed on mine.’\n",
      "At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an\n",
      "explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There was\n",
      "undoubtedly a blinding ﬂash of light. Winston was not hurt, only prostrated.\n",
      "Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he\n",
      "had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position. A terriﬁc\n",
      "painless blow had ﬂattened him out. Also something had happened inside his\n",
      "head. As his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and where\n",
      "he was, and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere\n",
      "or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken\n",
      "out of his brain.\n",
      "’It will not last,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "’Look me in the eyes.\n",
      "What country is\n",
      "Oceania at war with?’\n",
      "Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself\n",
      "was a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who\n",
      "148\n",
      "\n",
      "was at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that\n",
      "there was any war.\n",
      "’I don’t remember.’\n",
      "’Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that now?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of your\n",
      "life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history, the war has\n",
      "continued without a break, always the same war. Do you remember that?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’ Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been\n",
      "condemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a piece of\n",
      "paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed. You\n",
      "invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the very\n",
      "moment at which you ﬁrst invented it. Do you remember that?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "’Just now I held up the ﬁngers of my hand to you. You saw ﬁve ﬁngers. Do\n",
      "you remember that?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "O’Brien held up the ﬁngers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.\n",
      "’There are ﬁve ﬁngers there. Do you see ﬁve ﬁngers?’\n",
      "’Yes.’\n",
      "And he did see them, for a ﬂeeting instant, before the scenery of his mind\n",
      "changed. He saw ﬁve ﬁngers, and there was no deformity. Then everything\n",
      "was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came\n",
      "crowding back again. But there had been a moment — he did not know how\n",
      "long, thirty seconds, perhaps — of luminous certainty, when each new suggestion\n",
      "of O’Brien’s had ﬁlled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and\n",
      "when two and two could have been three as easily as ﬁve, if that were what was\n",
      "needed. It had faded but before O’Brien had dropped his hand; but though\n",
      "he could not recapture it, he could remember it, as one remembers a vivid\n",
      "experience at some period of one’s life when one was in eﬀect a diﬀerent person.\n",
      "’You see now,’ said O’Brien, ’that it is at any rate possible.’\n",
      "’Yes,’ said Winston.\n",
      "O’Brien stood up with a satisﬁed air. Over to his left Winston saw the man\n",
      "in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe.\n",
      "O’Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner he resettled\n",
      "his spectacles on his nose.\n",
      "’Do you remember writing in your diary,’ he said, ’that it did not matter\n",
      "whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who understood\n",
      "you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind\n",
      "appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane.\n",
      "Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions, if you\n",
      "choose.’\n",
      "’Any question I like?’\n",
      "’Anything.’ He saw that Winston’s eyes were upon the dial. ’It is switched\n",
      "oﬀ. What is your ﬁrst question?’\n",
      "’What have you done with Julia?’ said Winston.\n",
      "O’Brien smiled again. ’She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately-unreservedly.\n",
      "I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardly\n",
      "recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her\n",
      "149\n",
      "\n",
      "dirty-mindedness — everything has been burned out of her. It was a perfect\n",
      "conversion, a textbook case.’\n",
      "’You tortured her?’\n",
      "O’Brien left this unanswered. ’Next question,’ he said.\n",
      "’Does Big Brother exist?’\n",
      "’Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment of\n",
      "the Party.’\n",
      "’Does he exist in the same way as I exist?\n",
      "’You do not exist,’ said O’Brien.\n",
      "Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could\n",
      "imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were non-\n",
      "sense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, ’You do not exist’,\n",
      "contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so? His mind shrivelled\n",
      "as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with which O’Brien would\n",
      "demolish him.\n",
      "’I think I exist,’ he said wearily. ’I am conscious of my own identity. I was\n",
      "born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular point in space.\n",
      "No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously. In that sense,\n",
      "does Big Brother exist?’\n",
      "’It is of no importance. He exists.’\n",
      "’Will Big Brother ever die?’\n",
      "’Of course not. How could he die? Next question.’\n",
      "’Does the Brotherhood exist?’\n",
      "’That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we\n",
      "have ﬁnished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never\n",
      "learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live it\n",
      "will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.’\n",
      "Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had not\n",
      "asked the question that had come into his mind the ﬁrst. He had got to ask it,\n",
      "and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of\n",
      "amusement in O’Brien’s face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical\n",
      "gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what I am going to ask!\n",
      "At the thought the words burst out of him:\n",
      "’What is in Room 101?’\n",
      "The expression on O’Brien’s face did not change. He answered drily:\n",
      "’You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is in Room\n",
      "101.’\n",
      "He raised a ﬁnger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session was\n",
      "at an end. A needle jerked into Winston’s arm. He sank almost instantly into\n",
      "deep sleep.\n",

      "Chapter 20\n",
      "’There are three stages in your reintegration,’ said O’Brien. ’There is learning,\n",
      "there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon\n",
      "the second stage.’\n",
      "As always, Winston was lying ﬂat on his back. But of late his bonds were\n",
      "looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little\n",
      "and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow.\n",
      "The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he\n",
      "was quick-witted enough: it was chieﬂy when he showed stupidity that O’Brien\n",
      "pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of\n",
      "the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole\n",
      "process seemed to stretch out over a long, indeﬁnite time — weeks, possibly\n",
      "— and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days,\n",
      "sometimes only an hour or two.\n",
      "’As you lie there,’ said O’Brien, ’you have often wondered you have even\n",
      "asked me — why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble\n",
      "on you.\n",
      "And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially\n",
      "the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in,\n",
      "but not its underlying motives.\n",
      "Do you remember writing in your diary, ”I\n",
      "understand how: I do not understand why”? It was when you thought about\n",
      "”why” that you doubted your own sanity. You have read the book, Goldstein’s\n",

      "Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling\n",
      "of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had\n",
      "come back into O’Brien’s face. He knew in advance what O’Brien would say.\n",
      "That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good\n",
      "of the majority.\n",
      "That it sought power because men in the mass were frail\n",
      "cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must\n",
      "be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than\n",
      "themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness,\n",
      "and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party\n",
      "was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good\n",
      "might come, sacriﬁcing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing,\n",
      "thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O’Brien said this he would\n",
      "believe it. You could see it in his face. O’Brien knew everything. A thousand\n",
      "times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what\n",
      "degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities\n",
      "the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it\n",
      "made no diﬀerence: all was justiﬁed by the ultimate purpose. What can you\n",
      "do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself,\n",
      "who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?\n",
      "’You are ruling over us for our own good,’ he said feebly. ’You believe that\n",
      "human beings are not ﬁt to govern themselves, and therefore-’\n",
      "He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body.\n",
      "O’Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-ﬁve.\n",
      "’That was stupid, Winston, stupid!’ he said. ’You should know better than\n",
      "to say a thing like that.’\n",
      "He pulled the lever back and continued:\n",
      "’Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks\n",
      "power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others ; we\n",
      "are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness:\n",
      "only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently.\n",
      "We are diﬀerent from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we\n",
      "are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were- cowards\n",
      "and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very\n",
      "close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their\n",
      "own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized\n",
      "power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there\n",
      "lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like\n",
      "that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing\n",
      "it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in\n",
      "order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish\n",
      "the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture\n",
      "is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?’\n",
      "Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of\n",
      "O’Brien’s face. It was strong and ﬂeshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence\n",
      "and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was\n",
      "tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones.\n",
      "O’Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.\n",
      "152\n",
      "\n",
      "’You are thinking,’ he said, ’that my face is old and tired. You are thinking\n",
      "that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my\n",
      "own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell?\n",
      "The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you\n",
      "cut your ﬁngernails?’\n",
      "He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one\n",
      "hand in his pocket.\n",
      "’We are the priests of power,’ he said. ’God is power. But at present power is\n",
      "only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of\n",
      "what power means. The ﬁrst thing you must realize is that power is collective.\n",
      "The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You\n",
      "know the Party slogan: ”Freedom is Slavery”. Has it ever occurred to you that\n",
      "it is reversible? Slavery is freedom. Alone — free — the human being is always\n",
      "defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is\n",
      "the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he\n",
      "can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is\n",
      "the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to\n",
      "realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body but, above all,\n",
      "over the mind. Power over matter — external reality, as you would call it — is\n",
      "not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.’\n",
      "For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent eﬀort to raise\n",
      "himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body\n",
      "painfully.\n",
      "’But how can you control matter?’ he burst out. ’You don’t even control\n",
      "the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death-’\n",
      "O’Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. ’We control matter because\n",
      "we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by degrees,\n",
      "Winston.\n",
      "There is nothing that we could not do.\n",
      "Invisibility, levitation —\n",
      "anything. I could ﬂoat oﬀthis ﬂoor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I do not wish\n",
      "to, because the Party does not wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenth-\n",
      "century ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature.’\n",
      "’But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about\n",
      "Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.’\n",
      "’Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not,\n",
      "what diﬀerence would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania is\n",
      "the world.’\n",
      "’But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny helpless! How\n",
      "long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.’\n",
      "’Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older?\n",
      "Nothing exists except through human consciousness.’\n",
      "’But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals — mammoths and\n",
      "mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever\n",
      "heard of.’\n",
      "’Have you ever seen those bones, Winston?\n",
      "Of course not.\n",
      "Nineteenth-\n",
      "century biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if\n",
      "he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.’\n",
      "’But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are\n",
      "a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.’\n",
      "’What are the stars?’ said O’Brien indiﬀerently. ’They are bits of ﬁre a few\n",
      "kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them\n",
      "153\n",
      "\n",
      "out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.’\n",
      "Winston made another convulsive movement.\n",
      "This time he did not say\n",
      "anything. O’Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:\n",
      "’For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the\n",
      "ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often ﬁnd it convenient to assume that\n",
      "the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of\n",
      "kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a\n",
      "dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we\n",
      "need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you\n",
      "forgotten doublethink?’\n",
      "Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer\n",
      "crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he knew, that he was in the\n",
      "right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind — surely there\n",
      "must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been exposed\n",
      "long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. A\n",
      "faint smile twitched the corners of O’Brien’s mouth as he looked down at him.\n",
      "’I told you, Winston,’ he said, ’that metaphysics is not your strong point.\n",
      "The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is\n",
      "not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a diﬀerent thing: in\n",
      "fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,’ he added in a diﬀerent tone.\n",
      "’The real power, the power we have to ﬁght for night and day, is not power over\n",
      "things, but over men.’ He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of\n",
      "a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: ’How does one man assert his\n",
      "power over another, Winston?’\n",
      "Winston thought. ’By making him suﬀer,’ he said.\n",
      "’Exactly. By making him suﬀer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suf-\n",
      "fering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power\n",
      "is in inﬂicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces\n",
      "and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you\n",
      "begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite\n",
      "of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of\n",
      "fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon,\n",
      "a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it reﬁnes itself. Progress\n",
      "in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed\n",
      "that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our\n",
      "world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.\n",
      "Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the\n",
      "habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut\n",
      "the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between\n",
      "man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.\n",
      "But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken\n",
      "from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct\n",
      "will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a\n",
      "ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it\n",
      "now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be\n",
      "no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the\n",
      "laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no\n",
      "science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There\n",
      "will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,\n",
      "no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed.\n",
      "154\n",
      "\n",
      "But always — do not forget this, Winston — always there will be the intoxica-\n",
      "tion of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at\n",
      "every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on\n",
      "an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot\n",
      "stamping on a human face — for ever.’\n",
      "He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to\n",
      "shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything. His\n",
      "heart seemed to be frozen. O’Brien went on:\n",
      "’And remember that it is for ever.\n",
      "The face will always be there to be\n",
      "stamped upon.\n",
      "The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so\n",
      "that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have\n",
      "undergone since you have been in our hands — all that will continue, and\n",
      "worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions,\n",
      "the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a\n",
      "world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant:\n",
      "the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies\n",
      "will live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited,\n",
      "ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have\n",
      "played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again\n",
      "generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the\n",
      "heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible —\n",
      "and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his\n",
      "own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of\n",
      "victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing,\n",
      "pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to\n",
      "realize what that world will be like.\n",
      "But in the end you will do more than\n",
      "understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it.’\n",
      "Winston had recovered himself suﬃciently to speak. ’You can’t!’ he said\n",
      "weakly.\n",
      "’What do you mean by that remark, Winston?’\n",
      "’You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a dream.\n",
      "It is impossible.’\n",
      "’Why?’\n",
      "’It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. It\n",
      "would never endure.’\n",
      "’Why not?’\n",
      "’It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit suicide.’\n",
      "’Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting\n",
      "than love. Why should it be? And if it were, what diﬀerence would that make?\n",
      "Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken\n",
      "the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what diﬀerence would\n",
      "it make? Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death?\n",
      "The party is immortal.’\n",
      "As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he\n",
      "was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O’Brien would twist the\n",
      "dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with\n",
      "nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what O’Brien had said,\n",

      "perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves\n",

      "’Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why it\n",
      "should?’\n",
      "’No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe\n",

      "’Yes, I consider myself superior.’\n",
      "O’Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment\n",
      "Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the con-\n",
      "versation he had had with O’Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself\n",
      "in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to\n",
      "murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal dis-\n",
      "eases, to throw vitriol in a child’s face. O’Brien made a small impatient gesture,\n",
      "as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making. Then he\n",
      "turned a switch and the voices stopped.\n",
      "’Get up from that bed,’ he said.\n",
      "The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the ﬂoor\n",
      "and stood up unsteadily.\n",
      "’You are the last man,’ said O’Brien. ’You are the guardian of the human\n",
      "spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take oﬀyour clothes.’\n",
      "Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together.\n",
      "The zip\n",
      "fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember\n",
      "whether at any time since his arrest he had taken oﬀall his clothes at one\n",
      "time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with ﬁlthy yellowish rags, just\n",
      "recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid them to the ground\n",
      "he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room.\n",
      "He\n",
      "approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.\n",
      "’Go on,’ said O’Brien. ’Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall\n",
      "see the side view as well.’\n",
      "He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, grey-coloured, skeleton-\n",
      "like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and\n",
      "not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass.\n",
      "The creature’s face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A\n",
      "forlorn, jailbird’s face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a\n",
      "156\n",
      "\n",
      "crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were ﬁerce\n",
      "and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Cer-\n",
      "tainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than\n",
      "he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be diﬀerent from the\n",
      "ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the ﬁrst moment he had thought\n",
      "that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except\n",
      "for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient,\n",
      "ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds,\n",
      "and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inﬂamed mass with ﬂakes of skin\n",
      "peeling oﬀit. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body.\n",
      "The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk\n",
      "so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now what O’Brien had\n",
      "meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing.\n",
      "The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest,\n",
      "the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull.\n",
      "At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suﬀering\n",
      "from some malignant disease.\n",
      "’You have thought sometimes,’ said O’Brien, ’that my face — the face of a\n",

      "He seized Winston’s shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.\n",
      "’Look at the condition you are in!’ he said. ’Look at this ﬁlthy grime all\n",
      "over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that disgusting\n",
      "running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a goat? Probably\n",
      "you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I can\n",
      "make my thumb and foreﬁnger meet round your bicep. I could snap your neck\n",
      "like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-ﬁve kilograms since you\n",
      "have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!’ He\n",
      "plucked at Winston’s head and brought away a tuft of hair. ’Open your mouth.\n",
      "Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you when you came to us? And the\n",
      "few you have left are dropping out of your head. Look here!’\n",
      "He seized one of Winston’s remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb\n",
      "and foreﬁnger.\n",
      "A twinge of pain shot through Winston’s jaw.\n",
      "O’Brien had\n",
      "wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.\n",
      "’You are rotting away,’ he said; ’you are falling to pieces. What are you? A\n",

      "not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in his\n",
      "mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. Then\n",
      "suddenly as he ﬁxed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his\n",
      "ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed\n",
      "on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He was aware\n",
      "of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in ﬁlthy underclothes sitting\n",
      "weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself. O’Brien laid a\n",

      "Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.’\n",
      "He paused, and then went on:\n",
      "’We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen\n",
      "what your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there\n",

      "you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the ﬂoor in your own blood\n",

      "The peculiar reverence for O’Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy,\n",
      "ﬂooded Winston’s heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent!\n",
      "Never did O’Brien fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else on\n",
      "earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia. For what was\n",
      "there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture? He had told\n",
      "them everything he knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; he\n",

      "their adulteries, their vague plottings against the Party — everything. And yet,\n",
      "in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not\n",
      "stopped loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O’Brien\n",
      "had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.\n",
      "’Tell me,’ he said, ’how soon will they shoot me?’\n",
      "’It might be a long time,’ said O’Brien. ’You are a diﬃcult case. But don’t\n",

      "was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a\n",
      "pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given\n",

      "meat at every third meal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had\n",
      "no matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him\n",

      "He had long grown used to sleeping with a\n",

      "sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with\n",
      "O’Brien — not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful\n",
      "things. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his\n",

      "conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned,\n",
      "to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying.\n",
      "By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to\n",

      "\n",
      "his body. He would ﬁnger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was\n",
      "not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally\n",
      "it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were\n",
      "now deﬁnitely thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at ﬁrst, he began\n",
      "exercising himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres,\n",
      "measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter.\n",
      "He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to\n",
      "ﬁnd what things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk, he could\n",
      "not hold his stool out at arm’s length, he could not stand on one leg without\n",
      "falling over.\n",
      "He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing\n",
      "pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay\n",
      "ﬂat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he\n",
      "could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days — a few more\n",
      "mealtimes — even that feat was accomplished. A time came when he could\n",
      "do it six times running. He began to grow actually proud of his body, and to\n",
      "cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal.\n",
      "Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the\n",
      "seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror.\n",
      "His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against\n",
      "the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of\n",
      "re-educating himself.\n",
      "He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had been\n",
      "ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the moment\n",
      "when he was inside the Ministry of Love — and yes, even during those minutes\n",
      "when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told\n",
      "them what to do — he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt\n",
      "to set himself up against the power of the Party. He knew now that for seven\n",
      "years the Thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying\n",
      "glass. There was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not\n",
      "noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. Even the\n",
      "speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced.\n",
      "They had played sound-tracks to him, shown him photographs. Some of them\n",
      "were photographs of Julia and himself. Yes, even ... He could not ﬁght against\n",
      "the Party any longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It must be so; how\n",
      "could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard\n",
      "could you check its judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question\n",
      "of learning to think as they thought. Only!\n",
      "The pencil felt thick and awkward in his ﬁngers. He began to write down\n",
      "the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote ﬁrst in large clumsy capitals:\n",
      "FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\n",
      "Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:\n",
      "TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE\n",
      "But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away from\n",
      "something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what came\n",
      "next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it, it was\n",
      "only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come of its own\n",
      "accord. He wrote:\n",
      "GOD IS POWER\n",
      "He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been\n",
      "altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war\n",
      "160\n",
      "\n",
      "with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they\n",
      "were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt.\n",
      "It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered remembering contrary\n",
      "things, but those were false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it\n",
      "all was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It was like swimming\n",
      "against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and\n",
      "then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of oppos-\n",
      "ing it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude: the predestined thing\n",
      "happened in any case. He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled. Everything\n",
      "was easy, except!\n",
      "Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The\n",
      "law of gravity was nonsense. ’If I wished,’ O’Brien had said, ’I could ﬂoat oﬀ\n",
      "this ﬂoor like a soap bubble.’ Winston worked it out. ’If he thinks he ﬂoats oﬀ\n",
      "the ﬂoor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens.’\n",
      "Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water,\n",
      "the thought burst into his mind: ’It doesn’t really happen.\n",
      "We imagine it.\n",
      "It is hallucination.’ He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was\n",
      "obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was\n",
      "a ’real’ world where ’real’ things happened. But how could there be such a\n",
      "world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All\n",
      "happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.\n",
      "He had no diﬃculty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of\n",
      "succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred\n",
      "to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought\n",
      "presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they\n",
      "called it in Newspeak.\n",
      "He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with\n",
      "propositions — ’the Party says the earth is ﬂat’, ’the party says that ice is\n",
      "heavier than water’ — and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding\n",
      "the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers\n",
      "of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance,\n",
      "by such a statement as ’two and two make ﬁve’ were beyond his intellectual\n",
      "grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment\n",
      "to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the\n",
      "crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as diﬃcult\n",
      "to attain.\n",
      "All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would\n",
      "shoot him. ’Everything depends on yourself,’ O’Brien had said; but he knew\n",
      "that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It might\n",
      "be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years in solitary\n",
      "conﬁnement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might release him for\n",
      "a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible that before he was shot\n",
      "the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again.\n",
      "The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment. The\n",
      "tradition — the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never\n",
      "heard it said-was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the\n",
      "head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.\n",
      "One day — but ’one day’ was not the right expression; just as probably it\n",
      "was in the middle of the night: once — he fell into a strange, blissful reverie.\n",
      "He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was\n",
      "161\n",
      "\n",
      "coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled.\n",
      "There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear.\n",
      "His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement\n",
      "and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow\n",
      "white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage,\n",
      "a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced\n",
      "by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot-track across the\n",
      "old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet\n",
      "and the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the ﬁeld were the elm trees,\n",
      "faintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay\n",
      "in the green pools under the willows.\n",
      "Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on his\n",
      "backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:\n",
      "’Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!’\n",
      "For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence.\n",
      "She had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though\n",
      "she had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far\n",
      "more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew\n",
      "that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.\n",
      "He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done?\n",
      "How many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness?\n",
      "In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could\n",
      "not let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not\n",
      "known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them. He\n",
      "obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had hidden\n",
      "a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated\n",
      "a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the\n",
      "inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred to\n",
      "be in the wrong. They would understand that- O’Brien would understand it.\n",
      "It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.\n",
      "He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand\n",
      "over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There were deep\n",
      "furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose ﬂattened. Besides,\n",
      "since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of\n",
      "teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what\n",
      "your face looked like. In any case, mere control of the features was not enough.\n",
      "For the ﬁrst time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also\n",
      "hide it from yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until\n",
      "it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape\n",
      "that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right;\n",
      "he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred\n",
      "locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet\n",
      "unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.\n",
      "One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would\n",
      "happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It was\n",
      "always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough.\n",
      "In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, without\n",
      "a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a line in\n",
      "his face — suddenly the camouﬂage would be down and bang! would go the\n",
      "batteries of his hatred. Hatred would ﬁll him like an enormous roaring ﬂame.\n",
      "162\n",
      "\n",
      "And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early.\n",
      "They would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The\n",
      "heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their reach for ever.\n",
      "They would have blown a hole in their own perfection. To die hating them, that\n",
      "was freedom.\n",
      "He shut his eyes. It was more diﬃcult than accepting an intellectual disci-\n",
      "pline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He had got\n",
      "to plunge into the ﬁlthiest of ﬁlth. What was the most horrible, sickening thing\n",
      "of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (because of constantly\n",
      "seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide), with its\n",
      "heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to\n",
      "ﬂoat into his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings towards Big\n",
      "Brother?\n",
      "There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung open\n",
      "with a clang. O’Brien walked into the cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced\n",
      "oﬃcer and the black-uniformed guards.\n",
      "’Get up,’ said O’Brien. ’Come here.’\n",
      "Winston stood opposite him. O’Brien took Winston’s shoulders between his\n",
      "strong hands and looked at him closely.\n",
      "’You have had thoughts of deceiving me,’ he said. ’That was stupid. Stand\n",
      "up straighter. Look me in the face.’\n",
      "He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:\n",
      "’You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you. It is\n",
      "only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. Tell me, Winston —\n",
      "and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect a lie — tell\n",
      "me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?’\n",
      "’I hate him.’\n",
      "’You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step.\n",
      "You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him: you must love him.’\n",
      "He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.\n",
      "’Room 101,’ he said.\n",

      "Chapter 22\n",
      "At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know, where-\n",
      "abouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight diﬀerences\n",
      "in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him were below\n",
      "ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by O’Brien was high\n",
      "up near the roof. This place was many metres underground, as deep down as it\n",
      "was possible to go.\n",
      "It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed\n",
      "his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight\n",
      "in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a metre or two\n",
      "from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was strapped upright\n",
      "in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of\n",
      "pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of him.\n",
      "For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O’Brien came in.\n",
      "’You asked me once,’ said O’Brien, ’what was in Room 101. I told you that\n",
      "you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room\n",
      "101 is the worst thing in the world.’\n",
      "The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire,\n",
      "a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because of\n",
      "the position in which O’Brien was standing. Winston could not see what the\n",
      "thing was.\n",
      "’The worst thing in the world,’ said O’Brien, ’varies from individual to in-\n",
      "dividual. It may be burial alive, or death by ﬁre, or by drowning, or by impale-\n",
      "ment, or ﬁfty other deaths. There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing,\n",
      "not even fatal.’\n",
      "He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of the\n",
      "thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying\n",
      "it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask,\n",
      "with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres away from\n",
      "him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments,\n",
      "and that there was some kind of creature in each. They were rats.\n",
      "’In your case, said O’Brien, ’the worst thing in the world happens to be rats.’\n",
      "A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed\n",
      "through Winston as soon as he caught his ﬁrst glimpse of the cage. But at this\n",
      "moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank\n",
      "into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.\n",
      "’You can’t do that!’ he cried out in a high cracked voice. ’You couldn’t, you\n",
      "couldn’t! It’s impossible.’\n",
      "164\n",
      "\n",
      "’Do you remember,’ said O’Brien, ’the moment of panic that used to occur\n",
      "in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a roaring\n",
      "sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side of the wall.\n",
      "You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it into the open.\n",
      "It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.’\n",
      "’O’Brien!’ said Winston, making an eﬀort to control his voice. ’You know\n",
      "this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?’\n",
      "O’Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish\n",
      "manner that he sometimes aﬀected. He looked thoughtfully into the distance,\n",
      "as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winston’s back.\n",
      "’By itself,’ he said, ’pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a\n",
      "human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. But for\n",
      "everyone there is something unendurable — something that cannot be contem-\n",
      "plated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height\n",
      "it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is\n",
      "not cowardly to ﬁll your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be\n",
      "destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They\n",
      "are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand. even if you wished to. You\n",
      "will do what is required of you.\n",
      "’But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don’t know what it is?’\n",
      "O’Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. He set\n",
      "it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood singing in\n",
      "his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle\n",
      "of a great empty plain, a ﬂat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all\n",
      "sounds came to him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was\n",
      "not two metres away from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age\n",
      "when a rat’s muzzle grows blunt and ﬁerce and his fur brown instead of grey.\n",
      "’The rat,’ said O’Brien, still addressing his invisible audience, ’although a\n",
      "rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have heard of the things\n",
      "that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare\n",
      "not leave her baby alone in the house, even for ﬁve minutes. The rats are certain\n",
      "to attack it. Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. They\n",
      "also attack sick or dying people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing\n",
      "when a human being is helpless.’\n",
      "There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston\n",
      "from far away. The rats were ﬁghting; they were trying to get at each other\n",
      "through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed\n",
      "to come from outside himself.\n",
      "O’Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it. There\n",
      "was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic eﬀort to tear himself loose from the\n",
      "chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably.\n",
      "O’Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a metre from Winston’s face.\n",
      "’I have pressed the ﬁrst lever,’ said O’Brien. ’You understand the construc-\n",
      "tion of this cage. The mask will ﬁt over your head, leaving no exit. When I press\n",
      "this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes will\n",
      "shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? They\n",
      "will leap on to your face and bore straight into it. Sometimes they attack the\n",
      "eyes ﬁrst. Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.’\n",
      "The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of shrill\n",
      "cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But he fought\n",
      "165\n",
      "\n",
      "furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left —\n",
      "to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck\n",
      "his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost\n",
      "lost consciousness. Everything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a\n",
      "screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea. There\n",
      "was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human\n",
      "being, the body of another human being, between himself and the rats.\n",
      "The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of any-\n",
      "thing else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The rats\n",
      "knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the other,\n",
      "an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against\n",
      "the bars, and ﬁercely sniﬀed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the\n",
      "yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless,\n",
      "mindless.\n",
      "’It was a common punishment in Imperial China,’ said O’Brien as didacti-\n",
      "cally as ever.\n",
      "The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then\n",
      "— no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps\n",
      "too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was\n",
      "just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment — one body that\n",
      "he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically,\n",
      "over and over.\n",
      "’Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don’t care what you do to\n",
      "her. Tear her face oﬀ, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!’\n",
      "He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was\n",
      "still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the ﬂoor, through the walls\n",
      "of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere,\n",
      "into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars — always away, away, away\n",
      "from the rats. He was light years distant, but O’Brien was still standing at his\n",
      "side. There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. But through the\n",
      "darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the\n",

      "A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia: Oceania had always been\n",
      "at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day\n",
      "bulletin had not mentioned any deﬁnite area, but it was probable that already\n",
      "the mouth of the Congo was a battleﬁeld. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in\n",
      "danger. One did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not\n",
      "merely a question of losing Central Africa: for the ﬁrst time in the whole war,\n",
      "the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.\n",
      "A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undiﬀerentiated excitement,\n",

      "these days he could never ﬁx his mind on any one subject for more than a few\n",

      "the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly. The stuﬀwas horrible. The\n",
      "cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could\n",
      "not disguise the ﬂat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of\n",
      "gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind\n",
      "with the smell of those-\n",
      "He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he\n",
      "never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of, hovering\n",
      "close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he\n",
      "belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they released him, and\n",
      "had regained his old colour — indeed, more than regained it. His features had\n",
      "thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, seeing that Winston’s glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and ﬁlled\n",

      "was always waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when\n",
      "the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too\n",
      "close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular intervals\n",
      "they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, but\n",
      "he had the impression that they always undercharged him. It would have made\n",
      "no diﬀerence if it had been the other way about. He had always plenty of money\n",

      "citement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his\n",
      "mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-\n",
      "broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants.\n",
      "Why had it not been possible to outﬂank them in some way? The outline of the\n",
      "West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up the white knight\n",
      "and moved it across the board. There was the proper spot. Even while he saw\n",
      "the black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled,\n",
      "suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their comunications by land and sea. He\n",
      "felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. But it\n",
      "was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa,\n",
      "if they had airﬁelds and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in\n",

      "him.\n",
      "The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the\n",

      "wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the Park,\n",
      "on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass\n",
      "seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which\n",
      "had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying\n",
      "along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away\n",
      "from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-deﬁned way.\n",
      "They almost passed one another without a sign, then he turned and followed\n",
      "her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take\n",
      "any interest in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the\n",
      "grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having\n",
      "him at her side. Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leaﬂess shrubs,\n",
      "useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It\n",
      "was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional,\n",
      "dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.\n",
      "There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides,\n",
      "they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have lain\n",
      "down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to. His ﬂesh froze with\n",
      "horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp of\n",
      "his arm ; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had\n",
      "changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden\n",
      "by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It\n",
      "was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiﬀened.\n",
      "He remembered how once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped\n",
      "to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not only by the\n",
      "incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle,\n",
      "which made it seem more like stone than ﬂesh.\n",
      "Her body felt like that.\n",
      "It\n",
      "occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite diﬀerent from what\n",
      "it had once been.\n",
      "He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back\n",
      "across the grass, she looked directly at him for the ﬁrst time. It was only a\n",
      "momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a\n",
      "dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his\n",
      "bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They\n",
      "sat down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. He saw\n",
      "that she was about to speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and\n",
      "deliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.\n",
      "’I betrayed you,’ she said baldly.\n",
      "’I betrayed you,’ he said.\n",
      "She gave him another quick look of dislike.\n",
      "’Sometimes,’ she said, ’they threaten you with something something you\n",
      "can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. And then you say, ”Don’t do it to\n",
      "me, do it to somebody else, do it to So-and-so.” And perhaps you might pretend,\n",
      "afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop\n",
      "and didn’t really mean it. But that isn’t true. At the time when it happens you\n",
      "do mean it. You think there’s no other way of saving yourself, and you’re quite\n",

      "’And after that, you don’t feel the same towards the other person any longer.’\n",
      "’No,’ he said, ’you don’t feel the same.’\n",
      "There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their\n",
      "thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing to sit\n",
      "there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She said something about\n",
      "catching her Tube and stood up to go.\n",
      "’We must meet again,’ he said.\n",
      "’Yes,’ she said, ’we must meet again. ’\n",
      "He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her. They\n",
      "did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him oﬀ, but walked at\n",
      "just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his\n",
      "mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but suddenly\n",
      "this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable. He\n",
      "was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back\n",
      "to the Chestnut Tree Caf´e, which had never seemed so attractive as at this\n",

      "The next moment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become\n",

      "to catch up, then slowed down, turned, and made oﬀin the opposite direction.\n",
      "When he had gone ﬁfty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded,\n",

      "The Principles of Newspeak\n",
      "Newspeak was the oﬃcial language of Oceania and had been devised to meet\n",
      "the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was\n",
      "not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of communication,\n",
      "either in speech or writing. The leading articles in The Times were written in\n",
      "it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist.\n",
      "It was expected that Newspeak would have ﬁnally superseded Oldspeak (or\n",
      "Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it\n",
      "gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and\n",
      "grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version\n",
      "in use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak\n",
      "Dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superﬂuous words and\n",
      "archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the ﬁnal,\n",
      "perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that\n",
      "we are concerned here.\n",
      "The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for\n",
      "the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make\n",
      "all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had\n",
      "been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought —\n",
      "that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc — should be literally\n",
      "unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary\n",
      "was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every\n",
      "meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while exclud-\n",
      "ing all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect\n",
      "methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chieﬂy by\n",
      "eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of un-\n",
      "orthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever.\n",
      "To give a single example. The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could\n",
      "only be used in such statements as ’This dog is free from lice’ or ’This ﬁeld\n",
      "is free from weeds’. It could not be used in its old sense of ’ politically free’\n",
      "or ’intellectually free’ since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed\n",
      "even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the\n",
      "suppression of deﬁnitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded\n",
      "as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to\n",
      "survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of\n",
      "thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words\n",
      "down to a minimum.\n",
      "Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though\n",
      "many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,\n",
      "174\n",
      "\n",
      "would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak\n",
      "words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary, the\n",
      "B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be\n",
      "simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the\n",
      "language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since\n",
      "the same rules held good for all three categories.\n",
      "The A vocabulary.\n",
      "The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday\n",
      "life — for such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one’s clothes,\n",
      "going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. It\n",
      "was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit,\n",
      "run, dog, tree, sugar, house, ﬁeld — but in comparison with the present-day\n",
      "English vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were\n",
      "far more rigidly deﬁned. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged\n",
      "out of them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was\n",
      "simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept. It would\n",
      "have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for\n",
      "political or philosophical discussion. It was intended only to express simple,\n",
      "purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.\n",
      "The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities.\n",
      "The ﬁrst\n",
      "of these was an almost complete interchangeability between diﬀerent parts of\n",
      "speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract\n",
      "words such as if or when) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb.\n",
      "Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was\n",
      "never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic\n",
      "forms. The word thought, for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place\n",
      "was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological\n",
      "principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was\n",
      "chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of\n",
      "kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was\n",
      "frequently suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning\n",
      "being suﬃciently covered by the noun-verb knife. Adjectives were formed by\n",
      "adding the suﬃx-ful to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -wise. Thus for\n",
      "example, speedful meant ’rapid’ and speedwise meant ’quickly’. Certain of our\n",
      "present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft, were retained, but\n",
      "their total number was very small. There was little need for them, since almost\n",
      "any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding-ful to a noun-verb. None\n",
      "of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a very few already ending\n",
      "in-wise: the -wise termination was invariable. The word well, for example, was\n",
      "replaced by goodwise.\n",
      "In addition, any word — this again applied in principle to every word in the\n",
      "language — could be negatived by adding the aﬃx un- or could be strengthened\n",
      "by the aﬃx plus-, or, for still greater emphasis, doubleplus-. Thus, for example,\n",
      "uncold meant ’warm’, while pluscold and doublepluscold meant, respectively,\n",
      "’very cold’ and ’superlatively cold’. It was also possible, as in present-day En-\n",
      "glish, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional aﬃxes such\n",
      "as ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring\n",
      "about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word\n",
      "good, there was no need for such a word as bad, since the required meaning was\n",
      "equally well — indeed, better — expressed by ungood. All that was necessary,\n",
      "175\n",
      "\n",
      "in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide\n",
      "which of them to suppress. Dark, for example, could be replaced by unlight, or\n",
      "light by undark, according to preference.\n",
      "The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.\n",
      "Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inﬂexions followed\n",
      "the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the\n",
      "same and ended in-ed. The preterite of steal was stealed, the preterite of think\n",
      "was thinked, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as swam, gave,\n",
      "brought, spoke, taken, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding-s\n",
      "or-es as the case might be. The plurals of man, ox, life, were mans, oxes, lifes.\n",
      "Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding-er,-est (good, gooder,\n",
      "goodest), irregular forms and the more, most formation being suppressed.\n",
      "The only classes of words that were still allowed to inﬂect irregularly were the\n",
      "pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs.\n",
      "All of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scrapped\n",
      "as unnecessary, and the shall, should tenses had been dropped, all their uses\n",
      "being covered by will and would. There were also certain irregularities in word-\n",
      "formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which\n",
      "was diﬃcult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso\n",
      "facto a bad word: occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters\n",
      "were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need\n",
      "made itself felt chieﬂy in connexion with the B vocabulary. Why so great an\n",
      "importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in\n",
      "this essay.\n",
      "The B vocabulary.\n",
      "The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately con-\n",
      "structed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in\n",
      "every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable men-\n",
      "tal attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of the\n",
      "principles of Ingsoc it was diﬃcult to use these words correctly. In some cases\n",
      "they couId be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A\n",
      "vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved\n",
      "the loss of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often\n",
      "packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more\n",
      "accurate and forcible than ordinary language.\n",
      "The B words were in all cases compound words.\n",
      "They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in\n",
      "an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb,\n",
      "and inﬂected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the\n",
      "word goodthink, meaning, very roughly, ’orthodoxy’, or, if one chose to regard\n",
      "it as a verb, ’to think in an orthodox manner’. This inﬂected as follows: noun-\n",
      "verb, goodthink; past tense and past participle, goodthinked; present participle,\n",
      "good- thinking; adjective, goodthinkful; adverb, goodthinkwise; verbal noun,\n",
      "goodthinker.\n",
      "The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of\n",
      "which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed\n",
      "in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce\n",
      "while indicating their derivation. In the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for\n",
      "instance, the think came second, whereas in thinkpol Thought Police) it came\n",
      "ﬁrst, and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable. Because of the\n",
      "176\n",
      "\n",
      "great diﬃcuIty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the\n",
      "B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms of\n",
      "Minitrue, Minipax, and Miniluv were, respectively, Minitruthful, Minipeaceful,\n",
      "and Minilovely, simply because- trueful,-paxful, and-loveful were slightly awk-\n",
      "ward to pronounce. In principle, however, all B words could inﬂect, and all\n",
      "inﬂected in exactly the same way.\n",
      "Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to\n",
      "anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,\n",
      "such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as Oldthinkers unbellyfeel\n",
      "Ingsoc. The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspeak would\n",
      "be: ’Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full\n",
      "emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism.’ But this is not\n",
      "an adequate translation. To begin with, in order to\n",
      "Compound words such as speakwrite, were of course to be found in the A\n",
      "vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special\n",
      "ideologcal colour.\n",
      "grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would\n",
      "have to have a clear idea of what is meant by Ingsoc. And in addition, only\n",
      "a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the\n",
      "word bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance diﬃcult to imagine\n",
      "today; or of the word oldthink, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea\n",
      "of wickedness and decadence.\n",
      "But the special function of certain Newspeak\n",
      "words, of which oldthink was one, was not so much to express meanings as to\n",
      "destroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings\n",
      "extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which,\n",
      "as they were suﬃciently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now\n",
      "be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest diﬃculty facing the compilers of the\n",
      "Newspeak Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them,\n",
      "to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of\n",
      "words they cancelled by their existence.\n",
      "As we have already seen in the case of the word free, words which had once\n",
      "borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience,\n",
      "but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless other\n",
      "words such as honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science,\n",
      "and religion had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them,\n",
      "and, in covering them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves round\n",
      "the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single\n",
      "word crimethink, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of\n",
      "objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink. Greater\n",
      "precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was\n",
      "an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing\n",
      "much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped ’false gods’. He did\n",
      "not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth,\n",
      "and the like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his ortho-\n",
      "doxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore,\n",
      "that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In some-\n",
      "what the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct,\n",
      "and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure\n",
      "from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by\n",
      "the two Newspeak words sexcrime (sexual immorality) and goodsex (chastity).\n",
      "177\n",
      "\n",
      "Sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adul-\n",
      "tery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse\n",
      "practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately,\n",
      "since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death.\n",
      "In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientiﬁc and technical words, it might\n",
      "be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the\n",
      "ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by goodsex —\n",
      "that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose\n",
      "of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman:\n",
      "all else was sexcrime. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical\n",
      "thought further than the perception that it was heretical: beyond that point\n",
      "the necessary words were nonexistent.\n",
      "No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were\n",
      "euphemisms.\n",
      "Such words, for instance, as joycamp (forced-labour camp) or\n",
      "Minipax Ministry of Peace, i.\n",

      "Some words, on the other hand,\n",
      "displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic\n",
      "society. An example was prolefeed, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and\n",
      "spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again,\n",
      "were ambivalent, having the connotation ’good’ when applied to the Party and\n",
      "’bad’ when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of\n",
      "words which at ﬁrst sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived\n",
      "their ideological colour not from their meaning, but from their structure.\n",
      "So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political\n",

      "and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the\n",
      "early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been\n",
      "one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed\n",
      "that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in total-\n",
      "itarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such words as\n",
      "Nazi, Gestapo, Comin- tern, Inprecorr, Agitprop. In the beginning the practice\n",
      "had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with\n",
      "a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one\n",
      "narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associa-\n",
      "tions that would otherwise cling to it. The words Communist International, for\n",
      "instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red ﬂags,\n",
      "barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The word Comintern, on the\n",
      "other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-deﬁned body\n",
      "of doctrine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited\n",
      "in purpose, as a chair or a table. Comintern is a word that can be uttered\n",
      "almost without taking thought, whereas Communist International is a phrase\n",
      "over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way, the\n",
      "associations called up by a word like Minitrue are fewer and more controllable\n",
      "than those called up by Ministry of Truth. This accounted not only for the\n",
      "178\n",
      "\n",
      "habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated\n",
      "care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.\n",
      "In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exacti-\n",
      "tude of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacriﬁced to it when it\n",
      "seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for politi-\n",
      "cal purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be\n",
      "uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker’s mind.\n",
      "The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly\n",
      "all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words — goodthink,\n",
      "Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless\n",
      "others — were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally\n",
      "between the ﬁrst syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling\n",
      "style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what\n",
      "was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any\n",
      "subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of conscious-\n",
      "ness. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes\n",
      "necessary, to reﬂect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to make a\n",
      "political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions\n",
      "as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training ﬁtted\n",
      "him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the\n",
      "texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which\n",
      "was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.\n",
      "So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our own,\n",
      "the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly\n",
      "being devised.\n",
      "Newspeak, indeed, diﬀered from most all other languages in\n",
      "that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year. Each reduction\n",
      "was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to\n",
      "take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the\n",
      "larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all. This aim was frankly\n",
      "admitted in the Newspeak word duckspeak, meaning ’ to quack like a duck’.\n",
      "Like various other words in the B vocabulary, duckspeak was ambivalent in\n",
      "meaning. Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox\n",
      "ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when The Times referred to one of the\n",
      "orators of the Party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and\n",
      "valued compliment.\n",
      "The C vocabulary.\n",
      "The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely\n",
      "of scientiﬁc and technical terms. These resembled the scientiﬁc terms in use\n",
      "today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken\n",
      "to deﬁne them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings. They followed\n",
      "the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. Very\n",
      "few of the C words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political\n",
      "speech. Any scientiﬁc worker or technician could ﬁnd all the words he needed in\n",
      "the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering\n",
      "of the words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common\n",
      "to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a\n",
      "habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches.\n",
      "There was, indeed, no word for ’Science’, any meaning that it could possibly\n",
      "bear being already suﬃciently covered by the word Ingsoc.\n",
      "From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression\n",
      "179\n",
      "\n",
      "of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. It was\n",
      "of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy.\n",
      "It would have been possible, for example, to say Big Brother is ungood. But this\n",
      "statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity,\n",
      "could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary\n",
      "words were not available. Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained\n",
      "in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which\n",
      "lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without deﬁning them\n",
      "in doing so. One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by\n",
      "illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For example,\n",
      "All mans are equal was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same\n",
      "sense in which All men are redhaired is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did\n",
      "not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth-i.e. that\n",
      "all men are of equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equality\n",
      "no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged\n",
      "out of the word equal. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of\n",
      "communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words\n",
      "one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was not diﬃcult for\n",
      "any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this, but within a couple\n",
      "of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A person\n",
      "growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal\n",
      "had once had the secondary meaning of ’politically equal’, or that free had once\n",
      "meant ’intellectually free’, than for instance, a person who had never heard of\n",
      "chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook.\n",
      "There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power\n",
      "to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable.\n",
      "And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing\n",
      "characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced — its\n",
      "words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the\n",
      "chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.\n",
      "When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with\n",
      "the past would have been severed.\n",
      "History had already been rewritten, but\n",
      "fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there, imperfectly cen-\n",
      "sored, and so long as one retained one’s knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible\n",
      "to read them. In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive,\n",
      "would be unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any\n",
      "passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to some technical\n",
      "process or some very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (good-\n",
      "thinkful would be the NewsPeak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant\n",
      "that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole.\n",
      "Pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation —\n",
      "that is, alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known\n",
      "passage from the Declaration of Independence:\n",
      "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that\n",
      "they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among\n",
      "these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,\n",
      "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their powers from the consent\n",
      "of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive\n",
      "of those ends, it is the right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute\n",
      "new Government...\n",
      "180\n",

      "It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while\n",

      "would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink. A full\n",
      "translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jeﬀerson’s words\n",
      "would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.\n",
      "A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being trans-\n",
      "formed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve\n",
      "the memory of certain historical ﬁgures, while at the same time bringing their\n",
